REPATRIATING OFFSHORE FUNDS:     

  2004 TAX WINDFALL FOR SELECT MULTINATIONALS   

October 11, 2011   

 

 

     

 
In 2004, the America Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) permitted U.S. corporations to repatriate 
income held outside of the United States at an effective tax rate of 5.25% instead of the top 35% 
corporate income tax rate.    The purpose of this tax provision was to encourage companies to 
return cash assets to the United States, which proponents of the provision argued would spur 
increased domestic investment and U.S. jobs.1    In response, corporations returned $312 billion in 
qualified repatriation dollars to the United States and avoided an estimated $3.3 billion in tax 
payments,2  but the growth in American jobs and investment that was supposed to follow did not 
occur.3
                                                 
1    See U.S. Congress, Conference Committee, “American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,” Conference Report 
accompanying H.R. 4520, H.Rep. No. 108-755, 108th Cong., 2nd sess., at 316 (Washington: GPO, 2004) (hereinafter 
“Conference Report”) (“[I]n order to qualify for the deduction, dividends must be described in a domestic 
reinvestment plan [which] . . . must provide for the reinvestment of the repatriated dividends in the United States, 
including as a source for the funding of worker hiring and training, infrastructure, research and development, capital 
investments, and the financial stabilization of the corporation for the purposes of job retention or creation.”).    See 
also, e.g., 150 CONG. REC. S11038 (2004) (statement of Sen. Grassley) (“This bill contains some of the most important 
international tax reforms in decades, bringing foreign earnings home for investment in the United States instead of 
investing overseas, hence creating jobs in the United States.”); 150 CONG. REC. S4875 (2004) (statement of Sen. 
Graham) (“The rationale for this proposal is that reducing the tax rate will encourage U.S. multinational companies to 
expatriate income held offshore in order to make investments in the United States that will create jobs”); 150 CONG. 
REC. H8704 (2004) (Statement of Rep. Phil English-PA) (“Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to draw attention to one 
particular job-creating provision in this bill, which mirrors legislation I introduced and will lead to in-sourcing.    This 
provision, known as the Homeland Investment Act, is one of the strongest stimulus proposals brought before Congress 
in recent years, and I think it is going to have a huge impact.    It temporarily reduces the tax rate on foreign earnings of 
U.S. companies, when that money is brought back to the United States for investment here at home.    The billions of 
dollars that will be brought back will be used by American employers to hire new workers, invest in top-of-the-line 
equipment, and build new plants right here at home, instead of in the countries where their earnings are currently 
stranded.”); 150 CONG. REC. H8724 (2004) (statement of Rep. Udall-CO) (“I will vote for it because it includes 
provisions to encourage American corporations doing business abroad to repatriate their overseas earnings for 
investment here at home.    This has great potential to stimulate investment in new plant and equipment as well as in 
the research and development that support innovation, job creation, and prosperity.”); 150 CONG. REC. H4408 (2004) 
(statement of Rep. Eshoo-CA) (“I also strongly support the inclusion of incentives for corporations to repatriate their 
overseas profits which would stimulate the investment of hundreds of millions of dollars in our domestic economy”). 
2  See “stimated Budget Effects of the Conference Agreement for H.R. 4520, The ‘American Jobs Creation Act,’” 
Joint Committee on Taxation, JCX-69-04, Item IV.22 (10/7/2004) (estimating a tax revenue loss of $3.3 billion over 
ten years, 2005-2014), Report Exhibit 1.    See also Edward D. Kleinbard and Patrick Driessen, “A Revenue Estimate 
Case Study: The Repatriation Holiday Revisited,” 120 Tax Notes 1191 (9/22/2008) (noting that the Joint Committee 
on Taxation (JCT) had underestimated the total amount of dividends that would be claimed by corporations under the 
2004 repatriation provision, projecting a total of $235 billion instead of the actual $312 billion, but concluding that the 
data available in 2008 did not demonstrate that the estimated tax revenue loss of $3.3 billion over ten years was 
inaccurate).    While some dispute the JCT estimate and assert that the 2004 tax repatriation provision produced tax 
revenue of $16.4 billion [$312 billion in qualified dividends x 5.25%], that analysis fails to acknowledge that a portion 
of the dividends, $100 billion according to JCT’s estimate, would have been repatriated even without the 2004 law and 
under normal corporate tax rates would have produced revenues considerably in excess of $16.4 billion [for example, 
$100 billion x 35% = $35 billion].    It is that foregone revenue which forms the basis for the overall tax loss estimated 
by the JCT.

The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has long had an investigative 

interest in issues involving the movement of corporate funds to offshore jurisdictions and the 
treatment of those funds under the U.S. tax system.    Certain provisions of the U.S. tax code now 
encourage corporations to move jobs and money overseas.    For example, corporations may 
qualify for deductions and otherwise reduce their U.S. taxes for expenses that they incur to shut 
down U.S. plants and move their operations to other countries, and are even allowed to deduct 
interest on facilities they build offshore.4   Corporations can also defer taxes on the income of their 
foreign subsidiaries, generating tax savings, and use foreign tax credits to reduce their U.S. taxes.   
These and other tax provisions can encourage the outsourcing of American jobs.   In addition, over 
the past ten years, some U.S. corporations with multinational operations have been reporting 
“staggering increases” in profits offshore, while reducing the taxes they pay to the United States.5

 
To increase its understanding of these matters, the Subcommittee undertook a review of the 
2004 tax repatriation provision.    This Report describes the Subcommittee=s review and provides 
findings and recommendations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

A.  Subcommittee Review 

 

    The Subcommittee also collected information and documents and conducted interviews 

 
 
Beginning in 2009, the Subcommittee initiated a bipartisan review of the consequences of 
the 2004 repatriation provision which provided an exceptionally low tax rate to U.S. corporations 
with offshore funds.    As part of that review, the Subcommittee surveyed 20 major multinational 
corporations, including the 15 corporations that repatriated the highest amounts of funds back to 
the United States.    The survey sought information about the amounts of offshore funds repatriated 
to the United States, as well as data on domestic employment figures and corporate expenditures 
for executive compensation, stock buybacks, and other items over the six year period, 2002 to 
2008.6
with corporate representatives, tax professionals, and others.    In addition, the Subcommittee 
researched the 2004 legislation, reviewed academic and corporate studies of the impact of the 2004 
repatriation provision, and consulted with academic, tax, and other experts.   
 
 
The American Jobs Creation Act essentially provided guidelines on four uses of repatriated 
 
funds:    two – using funds for jobs and research and development – were encouraged, while two 
others – using funds for executive compensation and stock buybacks – were prohibited.   
Proponents of the 2004 repatriation claimed that it would encourage businesses to bring foreign 
income back into the United States to spur jobs growth, research and development expenditures, 
and other domestic investments; indeed, Congress made those objectives explicit requirements for 
spending repatriated funds.7
shows that, rather than producing new jobs or increasing research and development expenditures, 
the 2004 repatriation tax provision was followed by an increase in dollars spent on stock 
repurchases and executive compensation.    In addition, the repatriation tax break created a 
competitive disadvantage for domestic businesses that chose not to engage in offshore operations 
or investments, and provided a windfall for multinationals in a few industries without benefitting 
the U.S. economy as a whole.

6  This Report does not include the data from 2008, because the effect of the national recession overwhelmed other 
economic factors in that year.    The recession started in December 2007.    See National Bureau of Economic 
Research, “U.S. Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions,” http://www.nber.org/cycles.html. 
7  See 26 U.S.C. § 965(b)(4) (This section, entitled “Requirement to invest in the United States,” permits a deduction 
only if the qualified dividend is invested “in the United States . . . for the funding of worker hiring and training, 
infrastructure, research and development, capital investments, or the financial stabilization of the corporation for the 
purposes of job retention or creation.”).    See also supra note 1. 
 
 

 

B.  Report Findings   

4 

The Report makes the following findings of fact. 
 

 

1.  U.S. Jobs Lost Rather Than Gained.    After repatriating over $150 billion 
under the 2004 American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA), the top 15 repatriating 
corporations reduced their overall U.S. workforce by 20,931 jobs, while 
broad-based studies of all 840 repatriating corporations found no evidence that 
repatriated funds increased overall U.S. employment.   

 
2.  Research and Development Expenditures Did Not Accelerate.    After 

repatriating over $150 billion, the 15 top repatriating corporations showed slight 
decreases in the pace of their U.S. research and development expenditures, while 
broad-based studies of all 840 repatriating corporations found no evidence that 
repatriation funds increased overall U.S. research and development outlays. 

 
3. 

Stock Repurchases Increased After Repatriation.    Despite a prohibition on 
using repatriated funds for stock repurchases, the top 15 repatriating corporations 
accelerated their spending on stock buybacks after repatriation, increasing them 
16% from 2004 to 2005, and 38% from 2005 to 2006, while a broad-based study 
of all 840 repatriating corporations estimated that each extra dollar of repatriated 
cash was associated with an increase of between 60 and 92 cents in payouts to 
shareholders. 
 

 
4.  Executive Compensation Increased After Repatriation.    Despite a 

 

prohibition on using repatriated funds for executive compensation, after 
repatriating over $150 billion, annual compensation for the top five executives at 
the top 15 repatriating corporations jumped 27% from 2004 to 2005, and another 
30%, from 2005 to 2006, with ten of the corporations issuing restricted stock 
awards of $1 million or more to senior executives. 

 
5.  Only a Narrow Sector of Multinationals Benefited.    Repatriation primarily 

benefited a narrow slice of the American economy, returning about $140 billion 
in repatriated dollars to multinational corporations in the pharmaceutical and 
technology industries, while providing no benefit to domestic firms that chose not 
to engage in offshore operations or investments. 

 
6.  Most Repatriated Funds Flowed from Tax Havens.    Funds were repatriated 

primarily from low tax or tax haven jurisdictions; seven of the surveyed 
corporations repatriated between 90% and 100% of their funds from tax havens.     

 
7.  Offshore Funds Increased After 2004 Repatriation.    Since the 2004 AJCA 

repatriation, the corporations that repatriated substantial sums have built up their

offshore funds at a greater rate than before the AJCA, evidence that repatriation 
has encouraged the shifting of more corporate dollars and investments offshore. 

 
8.  More than $2 Trillion in Cash Assets Now Held by U.S. Corporations.    In 
2011, U.S. corporations have record domestic cash assets of around $2 trillion, 
indicating that that the availability of cash is not constraining hiring or domestic 
investment decisions and that allowing corporations to repatriate more cash 
would be an ineffective way to spur new jobs. 

 
9.  Repatriation is a Failed Tax Policy.    The 2004 repatriation cost the U.S. 

Treasury an estimated net revenue loss of $3.3 billion over ten years, produced no 
appreciable increase in U.S. jobs or research investments, and led to U.S. 
corporations directing more funds offshore.   

C.    Report Recommendation 

 
The Report recommends against enacting a second corporate repatriation tax break due to 
the harms associated with a substantial revenue loss, failed jobs stimulus, and added incentive for 
U.S. corporations to move jobs and investment offshore.     

 

   

   

  II.  BACKGROUND 
 

A.  The U.S. International Tax System 

       

The United States operates on a worldwide tax system under which U.S. corporations 

generally are taxed on their income, no matter where it is earned.    This approach applies to the 
earnings of a domestic corporation=s subsidiaries, including controlled foreign corporations 
(CFCs).    One key feature of this approach is deferral.    Under current law, income earned by a 
domestic parent corporation from foreign operations conducted by its foreign subsidiaries is 
subject to U.S. tax.    Foreign income is actually taxed, however, only at the point when the income 
is repatriated, that is, brought back to the United States.    Until foreign income is returned as 
income to the U.S. parent corporation, the U.S. tax on such income is deferred.    Deferral is 
restricted by rules located in Subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code that require U.S. shareholders 
with a 10% or more stake in a CFC to pay tax on passive income or income from certain types of 
sales transactions, such as between related firms.8

               

 
The U.S. tax code also provides foreign tax credits, which are intended to avoid double 

taxation of corporate income where U.S. and foreign governments’ tax jurisdictions overlap.    The 
foreign tax credit is available to U.S. corporations to offset U.S. tax liability by the amount of tax 
paid to other countries.9
    Domestic firms can claim foreign tax credits for foreign taxes paid by

their subsidiaries on foreign earnings used to pay repatriated dividends to the U.S. parent 
company.    Deferral allows U.S. corporations to reap the benefits of a lower foreign tax rate on 
foreign earnings for as long as those foreign earnings remain overseas.    Deferral, then, makes it 
more attractive for U.S. firms to leave funds offshore in countries with low tax rates.     

 
The current top corporate statutory tax rate in the United States is 35%.10    The effective 

   

marginal tax rate paid by many corporations after accounting for credits, deductions, and 
sometimes profit shifting, however, is much lower.    A University of North Carolina study of U.S. 
multinationals= effective tax rates from 2003 to 2007, for example, shows that U.S. multinationals 
paid a tax rate of 26% on average, comparable to the global average rate of 25%.11

 
B.  America Jobs Creation Act of 2004     
 
 
The Homeland Investment Act, which was incorporated into the American Jobs Creation 
Act (AJCA) of 2004 (P.L. 108-357), provided a one-time reduction in the tax rate on repatriated 
income.    The repatriation provision, codified in a new Section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code, 
was intended to encourage U.S. corporations to repatriate foreign income and use the funds for 
domestic investment that would promote U.S. jobs growth.12
 
 
As noted above, foreign income earned by U.S. corporations is not taxed until it is 
repatriated.    Repatriated income is then treated as a dividend paid by a controlled foreign 
corporation (CFC) to its domestic parent corporation.    The 2004 AJCA repatriation provision 
allowed corporations to deduct from their taxable income 85% of the “qualifying dividends” 
received from their CFCs during either 2004, 2005, or 2006.13

Rates: International Comparisons,” (Nov. 2005).    See also “Comparison of the Reported Tax Liabilities of Foreign- 
and U.S.-Controlled Corporations, 1998-2005,” Government Accountability Office (GAO), No. GAO-08-957 (July 
2008).    This GAO report found that, for the eight-year period 1998 to 2005, about 1.2 million U.S. controlled 
corporations (USCCs), or 67% of the returns filed, paid no tax, despite having total gross receipts of $2.1 trillion.    The 
report also found that about 55% of large USCCs reported no tax liability for at least one year during the eight years 
studied.

2005-64 (providing guidance for use by corporations of section 965).    See also U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, 
AAn Examination of U.S. Tax Policy and Its Effects on the International Competitiveness of U.S.-Owned Foreign 
Operations,@ S.Hrg. 108-337 (7/15/2003) (discussing the concept of a repatriation tax break as a measure to stimulate 
domestic investment and U.S. job creation).    The Senate considered legislation to initiate a second repatriation tax 
break in 2009, but defeated the proposal.    See Boxer-Ensign Amendment No. 112, which failed by a vote of 52-44, 
CONG. REC. S1420 (2/3/2009). 
13  The deduction could be claimed only for a single year, which could be either the last tax year that began before 
October 22, 2004, or the last tax year that began during the one-year period beginning on October 22, 2004.    See 26 
U.S.C. § 965(f).    Because companies have different tax years, the result was that the repatriation deduction could be 
taken over a three-year period, from 2004 to 2006.    The deduction was required to be taken on a timely filed return for 
the taxable year with respect to which the deduction was claimed.    See Conference Report, at 314. 

 

For corporations that were taxed at the statutory corporate rate of 35%, allowing 85% of 

 
 
the qualifying dividends to be deducted from their taxable income reduced the effective tax rate on 
the qualifying dividends to 5.25%.14    The repatriation provision also placed limits on the type and 
amounts of dividends that could “qualify” for the deduction and required the dividends to be used 
to fund allowable domestic investments.    To qualify for the deductions, dividends had to be 
“extraordinary,” that is, the dividends received by the U.S. parent had to exceed the average 
dividends received from its CFCs over a five-year base period.15    Additionally, the amount of 
qualifying dividends was limited to the greater of $500 million or either the amount of earnings 
permanently reinvested outside the United States according to the corporation=s balance sheet of its 
most recently audited financial statements as of June 30, 2003, or 35% of the specific tax liability 
attributable to earnings permanently reinvested outside the United States.16

 

 
Congress intended that the deduction be limited to funds that would be used for job 

creation, capital investment, and other growth-producing expenditures described in a domestic 
reinvestment plan prepared by the corporation taking the deduction.17    However, in a major 
statutory failing, the law did not provide any requirement to track repatriated funds to ensure they 
were spent on permitted uses.    The Conference Report simply stated that “in order to qualify for 
the deduction, dividends must be described in a domestic reinvestment plan approved by the 
taxpayer=s senior management and board of directors.”18    The Conference Report then set forth a 
non-exclusive list of permitted uses of repatriated dividends:    “funding of worker hiring and 
training, infrastructure, research and development, capital investments, and the financial 
stabilization of the corporation for the purposes of job retention or creation.”19    Use of repatriated 
funds for executive compensation was expressly prohibited;20  as was their use for share 
repurchases.21
    In the absence of any tracking requirement, however, the statute failed to provide 
any means for auditing repatriated funds to gauge compliance.    Because corporations had no legal 
obligation to substantiate how they used repatriated funds, no documentary evidence was obtained 
establishing that corporations explicitly misapplied repatriated funds to prohibited uses in 
violation of the law.   
 

The deduction was designed and intended to be available for a single year.    The 

Conference Report stated:    “The conferees emphasize that this is a temporary economic stimulus 
measure, and that there is no intent to make this measure permanent, or to >extend= or enact it again

14  The 5.25% rate is determined by multiplying 15% of taxable dividends by the top corporate tax rate of 35% [15% of 
taxable dividends x 35% = 5.25%].

in the future.”22
    Doing otherwise was seen as encouraging corporations to stockpile earnings 
outside the United States in anticipation of future repatriation provisions, expand their offshore 
operations, and move more jobs overseas, and as making offshore operations more profitable than 
domestic operations. 

    Generally, corporations claiming the deduction were large multinational 

 
C.    2004 AJCA Repatriation Profile 
 
After enactment of the AJCA, 843 corporations repatriated $312 billion that qualified for 

 
 
the lower tax rate.23
firms repatriating substantial offshore funds.     
 
 
Five firms – Pfizer, Merck, Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson, and IBM – accounted 
for $88 billion, representing more than 28% of total repatriations.24    The top 10 firms – adding 
Schering-Plough, DuPont, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, and PepsiCo – accounted for 42% of 
total repatriated funds.25    The top 15 – adding Procter & Gamble, Intel, Coca-Cola, Altria, and 
Oracle – accounted for over half or 52% of total repatriations.26    According to the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS), for the 843 repatriating corporations as a whole, the average amount 
repatriated was roughly $429 million, while the average qualifying dividend was $370 million.27
   

Most corporations, 86%, reported the deduction for tax year 2005, while 7.7% reported it 

for tax year 2004, and the remaining 6.8% reported it for tax year 2006.28
surveyed by the Subcommittee, 17 corporations or 89% reported the deduction for tax year 2005, 
and two corporations or 11% reported it for tax year 2006.

cash dividends that actually qualified for the deduction under Section 965.    Those qualified cash dividend amounts, 
which were disclosed by the surveyed corporations to the Subcommittee and were not publicly available, provide an 
exact measure of the funds those corporations repatriated under the AJCA.    Other articles have used a slightly 
different approach, focusing on the total cash dividends that each corporation returned to the United States from its 
CFCs, as reported in the corporations’ publicly available financial statements.    This approach identified the same 15 
corporations as the Subcommittee survey, with one exception.    By the latter measure, total cash dividends from the 
CFCs, the 15th highest repatriating company was Motorola, and the 19th was Oracle, while by the Subcommittee’s 
measure, total qualifying cash dividends, the 15th highest repatriating company was Oracle, and the 16th was Motorola.

III.  SUBCOMMITTEE REVIEW     

9 

 
In 2009, the Subcommittee initiated its review into the effectiveness of the 2004 

repatriation provision.    The 2004 provision required that corporations develop a domestic 
reinvestment plan describing the intended use of repatriated funds as a source for the funding of 
worker hiring and training, infrastructure, research and development, capital investments, or 
financial stabilization for purposes of job retention or creation.    The 2004 provision did not, 
however, require corporations to identify or track repatriated funds to make sure that they were 
actually used for the purposes enumerated in the statute.    The Subcommittee=s review sought to 
determine the size of repatriated funds, where the funds came from, and how these funds were 
employed.    In particular, the review focused on the relationship between repatriated funds and the 
two major permitted uses for the funds, jobs and research and development expenditures, and the 
two prohibited uses, share repurchases and executive compensation.   
 

The evidence showed that the one-time repatriation provision did not achieve the 

objectives identified in the legislation and, in fact, encouraged additional corporate funds to leave 
the United States to be kept offshore.    The data showed, for example, no evidence that the 
repatriation provision increased U.S. jobs.    For research and development budgets, surveyed 
corporations increased their expenditures after repatriating funds but at roughly the same rates as 
before repatriation.    The Subcommittee review also found that, because money is fungible and 
corporations were not required to track expenditures of repatriated funds, it was impossible to 
determine if the surveyed corporations used their repatriated funds to increase planned 
expenditures for worker training and hiring in the United States or for research and development 
(R&D), or instead used the repatriated funds to pay for expenses that had already been planned and 
would have been made in any event, and then used freed up funds to pay for prohibited purposes 
such as increased stock repurchases or executive compensation.    The data is clear, however, at the 
surveyed corporations that repatriated substantial offshore funds, U.S. jobs decreased overall and 
the pace of R&D outlays did not increase after repatriation, while expenditures on stock 
repurchases and executive compensation increased substantially.     
 

By allowing over $300 billion in offshore funds to be brought back subject to a 5.25% tax 

rate instead of the top 35% rate, the U.S. Treasury lost out on billions of dollars in tax revenues 
with no evidence of the benefits that it expected to receive in exchange for the loss.    Section 965 
also served as an additional incentive for U.S. multinationals to send more jobs, funds, and 
facilities offshore in anticipation of future opportunities to utilize extraordinarily low corporate 
income tax rates.    Finally, repatriation disadvantaged U.S. small and mid-sized businesses by 
giving multinational corporations an unfair competitive edge through a lower tax burden. 

 
A.  Results of the Subcommittee Survey     

 

To gain a better understanding of the impact and implementation of the 2004 repatriation 
provision, the Subcommittee sent questionnaires to 20 U.S.-based multinational corporations that 

 

 

10 

    The questionnaire sought to discover how the 

 
took advantage of the 2004 repatriation.29
repatriated funds were used by the corporations in the four key areas, American jobs, research and 
development, stock repurchases, and executive compensation.    The review inquired into the 
amount of funds that had been repatriated; the amount that was planned to be spent; and how the 
funds had actually been used, including how much the corporation spent on hiring, research and 
development, stock repurchases, and executive compensation.     
 

All 20 corporations that the Subcommittee contacted responded to the questionnaire.    All 

20 provided the Subcommittee with a copy of their domestic reinvestment plans indicating how 
repatriated funds would be spent.    The corporations also described how they actually spent the 
repatriated funds.    This Report utilizes data from 19 of the 20 corporations that provided 
information to the Subcommittee.30    Because the 2004 provision did not require specific tracking 
of the repatriated funds, the corporations did not have contemporaneous documentation 
identifying specific expenditures of repatriated dollars.    Instead, the Subcommittee relied on the 
information each corporation provided, as well as filings with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC), IRS published data, and other research and survey results to develop data on 
the amounts repatriated and amounts spent on hiring, research and development, stock 
repurchases, and executive compensation.31

   

 

1.  U.S. Jobs   

 
The Homeland Investment Act’s repatriation provision was included in the American Jobs 

Creation Act primarily to increase U.S. jobs.    The survey accordingly compared the level of 
repatriation at the corporations surveyed and the changes in the size of their U.S. workforce, 
considering both job gains and losses.   

   
 
With respect to the top 15 repatriating corporations, 10 or 66% recorded U.S. job losses 
from 2004 to 2007, while five or 33% recorded job gains.    Among all 19 of the Subcommittee’s 
survey participants, 12 or 63% of the 19 corporations recorded U.S. job losses from 2004 to 2007, 
                                                 
29 The Subcommittee surveyed the 15 companies with the highest amounts of qualifying repatriated dividends.    See 
supra note 26.    In addition, the Subcommittee surveyed five companies that were significant repatriators of total 
dividends: Motorola, the 16th highest repatriating company; Wyeth, the 20th highest repatriating company (which was 
acquired by Pfizer in 2009); Honeywell International Inc., the 25th highest repatriating company; Cisco Systems Inc., 
the 40th highest repatriating company; and Microsoft, the 54th highest repatriating company.    See Rodney P. Mock 
and Andreas Simon, APermanently Reinvested Earnings: Priceless,@ 121 Tax Notes 835, at 835-848 (11/17/2008) 
(listing top 81 repatriating companies under the American Jobs Creation Act).    These companies were also major 
players in the technology industry, one of the main beneficiaries of the AJCA. 
30  The Report does not make use of the data provided by Cisco Systems, because Cisco informed the Subcommittee 
that, after claiming a $1.2 billion dividend received deduction under the AJCA in 2006, it later amended its 2006 tax 
return and no longer took the $1.2 billion deduction.    See Report Exhibit 2.    Cisco told the Subcommittee that this 
action was the result of a larger settlement with the IRS of issues related to a 2002-2004 audit, which resulted in Cisco 
recharacterizing the $1.2 billion as previously taxed and therefore not subject to any additional tax.   According to 
Cisco, since the funds were considered previously taxed, they were no longer considered a dividend. 
31  The survey results for the 20 corporations are set forth in Tables 1 through 5, in the Appendix at the end of this 
Report. 

 

 

11 

 
while seven or 37% recorded job gains.    The following chart depicts the job losses and gains at 
each corporation.    Overall, the U.S. job losses outweighed the job gains.    The aggregate net job 
change figure among the top 15 repatriating corporations was a loss of 20,931 jobs in the United 
States from 2004 to 2007.32    Using all 19 surveyed corporations, the net job change was the loss 
of 13,585 U.S. jobs over the same period.    For both groups of corporations, the top 15 and all 
surveyed corporations, U.S. jobs decreased in 2005, the year in which the most funds were 
repatriated, rose less than a percentage point in 2006, and then decreased again in 2007.33
   
 

                                                 
32  These figures are conservative, in that they do not reflect any reduction in Altria job totals after Altria spun off Kraft 
Foods Inc. in March 2007.    See 2/18/09 Altria Response to Subcommittee Survey, Report Exhibit 3.    Despite Altria 
disclosures indicating that its workforce dropped by nearly 40,000 due to Kraft’s departure from the company, the 
domestic job count figures and charts in this section include Kraft’s 2007 domestic job count in Altria’s 2007 job total 
in an attempt to fairly present the number of jobs that stayed in the United States as opposed to jobs that were 
eliminated entirely. 
33  For the top 15 repatriating corporations, U.S. jobs increased 5.9% from 2002 to 2003, decreased 3.3% from 2003 to 
2004, decreased 1.5% from 2004 to 2005, increased 0.1% from 2005 to 2006, and decreased 1.9% from 2006 to 2007.   
For all 19 surveyed corporations, U.S. jobs increased 3.9% from 2002 to 2003, decreased 4.0% from 2003 to 2004, 
decreased 1.0% from 2004 to 2005, increased 0.2% from 2005 to 2006, and decreased 0.9% from 2006 to 2007.

Overall, the top 15 repatriating corporations reduced their U.S. workforce despite 

repatriating large amounts that qualified for the lower tax rate.    The chart below shows that these 
two developments, the increased repatriation of funds versus decreased U.S. employment, moved 
in opposite directions, contradicting the prediction that the lines would move in approximately the 
same direction in response to Congress’ guidance that repatriated dollars be used to stimulate the 
creation of new U.S. jobs.    The survey data shows that, overall, the biggest repatriation

When the Subcommittee asked each of the 19 surveyed corporations for data showing the 
extent to which their repatriated dollars were used to increase the corporation’s U.S. workforce, 
none of the corporations was able to quantify the amount of repatriated funds used for job creation 
or to document the amount of job increases, if any, that resulted.    Of the seven corporations that 
increased domestic employment after enactment of Section 965, only two even identified 
repatriated funds as a contributing factor to their U.S. job increases.36

 
Of those two corporations, one told the Subcommittee that its increased spending on U.S. 
employees was partly attributable to funds repatriated under Section 965, but was unable to detail 
the role played by the repatriated funds.37    The second corporation, which reported the largest job 
gain among the top 15 repatriators, claimed an increase in the size of its U.S. workforce during the 
covered period in part due to its ability to use repatriated funds to acquire two other U.S. 
corporations.38
                                                 
36  The two companies were Oracle and Microsoft.

38 2/17/2009 Oracle Response to Subcommittee Survey, Report Exhibit 5 (“As noted in Oracle's DRP, a portion of 
Oracle's repatriated funds was used in FY 2005 for two key acquisitions critical to Oracle's long-term growth and 
competitiveness internationally.    For example, repatriated cash enabled Oracle to outbid and acquire Retek Inc., a 

     

   

 

 

The remaining corporations told the Subcommittee that they had no data or records to 

indicate whether repatriated funds contributed to job increases or were ever used for that purpose.   
As one corporation put it:    “We do not maintain data, and we have not made estimates, of how our 
U.S. jobs and U.S. research and development expenditures would have been different if amounts 
had not been repatriated under section 965.”39
fungibility of money, they were unable to identify whether repatriated dollars or other funds were 
used to increase jobs.    One corporation made the broad statement that offshore funds repatriated 
at a lower tax rate would allow it to pursue unnamed “business opportunities” to “increase sales”:   

    Other corporations noted that, due to the 

 
“While it is difficult to point to a direct connection between repatriation and jobs and 
research and development, when a company can access cash at a lower rate, it is placed in a 
much better position to capitalize on new business opportunities and investments in 
research and development to increase sales volumes.”40

 

 

Despite that positive statement and repatriating $10 billion in 2005, that particular corporation 
reduced rather than increased its U.S. workforce over the following two years.41

 

 
The Report’s finding that the repatriating corporations examined by the Subcommittee did 

    The CRS study stated:    “While empirical evidence is clear 

not increase their American workforce overall is not unique to the corporations featured in the 
Subcommittee survey.    Research has shown that, across all 840 repatriating corporations, the 
2004 repatriation did not stimulate U.S. job growth.    Analyses by the Congressional Research 
Service (CRS) in 2011, for example, concluded that the 2004 repatriation did not produce 
increased domestic employment.42
                                                                                                                                                             
Minnesota-based provider of retail software and services.    SAP AG had made an offer to acquire Retek, and stated 
publicly that it intended to move Retek's development jobs and intellectual property to Germany.    Oracle's successful 
acquisition of Retek had the immediate effect of retaining all of Retek's jobs in Minnesota and Georgia.    Since the 
Retek acquisition, Oracle has increased by 50% its Retek related employment in Minnesota and Georgia.”).    The two 
acquisitions referenced by Oracle involved its purchase of Retek Inc. and PeopleSoft Inc.    Prior to being acquired by 
Oracle in 2005, Retek reported in its SEC filings that it had 531 worldwide jobs, while PeopleSoft reported that it had 
8,748 employees in the United States.    Oracle informed the Subcommittee that, in 2005, it increased its U.S. 
workforce by 4,440 jobs over the prior year.    That 4,440 total, which reflects less than half the number of jobs brought 
to Oracle by Retek and PeopleSoft, indicates that, after acquiring the two companies, Oracle actually eliminated 
thousands of jobs previously held by U.S. workers.    See, e.g., “Jobs Go at Oracle After Takeover,” BBC News 
(1/15/2005) (“The cuts will affect about 9% of the 55,000 staff of the combined companies.”); Todd Wallack, “Reality 
Soothes Layoff Fears / PeopleSoft, Oracle Share Firings Evenly at Bay Area Sites,” San Francisco Chronicle 
(3/25/2005) (“But after the takeover, Oracle announced plans in January to eliminate 5,000 jobs worldwide, mostly 
from the PeopleSoft side of the company.”).

that this provision resulted in a significant increase in repatriated earnings, empirical evidence is 
unable to show a corresponding increase in domestic investment or employment by firms that 
utilized the repatriation provisions.”43    A 2009 study using data from the National Bureau of 
Economic Research concluded:    “The ability to access an internal source of capital at a lower cost 
did not boost domestic investment, employment, or R&D.”44
 

 

2.  Research and Development Expenditures   

 
Under the AJCA, research and development (R&D) was another permitted, and 

encouraged, use of repatriated funds.    The Subcommittee’s survey data showed that, at the top 15 
repatriating corporations, R&D expenditures increased from 2004 through 2007, but at slightly 
lower rates than occurred before repatriation.    For the top 15 repatriating corporations, the 
average annual percentage increase in R&D spending ranged between 4% and 7% from 2002 to 
2007.45    Similarly, for the 19 surveyed corporations, the average annual percentage increase in 
R&D spending ranged from 3% to 7% from 2002 to 2007.46

    

 
In the graphs below, the line indicating R&D expenditures shows a smooth, consistent rise 

from the time period before repatriation (2002 to 2003) through the period in which funds were 
repatriated (2005 to 2006), and in the year after (2007).    That is, even though the top 15 
corporations collectively experienced an influx of $149 billion in repatriated funds in 2005, and 
another $6 billion in 2006, the rise in their collective R&D spending during those years is 
consistent with the gradual increase in R&D spending before repatriation.    For the 19 surveyed 
corporations, there is a slight increase in the line showing increased R&D spending from 2003 to

“these studies both found the repatriation provisions to be an ineffective means of increasing economic growth.”

43  CRS Study, at 1.    The CRS study also pointed out that flexible exchange rates would likely have depressed any 
stimulative impact of any sizeable repatriation due to currency conversions and the resulting international trade flows.   
The CRS Study stated:    “The stimulative effect of the reduced tax rate on repatriated earnings is expected to be muted 
by the international system of flexible exchange rates and, subsequently, by trade.    This effect will occur, because as 
foreign denominated earnings of foreign subsidiaries are repatriated they are also converted to dollars.    This result 
increases demand for dollars which leads to an appreciation, or increase, in the price of the dollar in foreign exchange 
markets.    This stronger dollar makes U.S.-made exports more expensive and foreign imports less expensive.    As a 
result, U.S. exports would temporarily decline, further straining the economy and at least partially offsetting any 
stimulative effect of the repatriated earnings.”    CRS Study, at 8.

What I Do, Not What I Say:    The Unintended Consequences of the Homeland Investment Act,” 66 Journal of Finance 
753, 772 (June 2011). 
45  The annual percentage increase in R&D expenditures for the top 15 repatriating corporations was 7.3% from 2002 
to 2003, 5.7% from 2003 to 2004, 4.3% from 2004 to 2005, 4.9% from 2005 to 2006, and 3.7% from 2006 to 2007. 
46 The annual percentage increase in R&D expenditures for the 19 surveyed repatriating corporations was 6.5% from 
2002 to 2003, 6.0% from 2003 to 2004, 5.1% from 2004 to 2005, 5.9% from 2005 to 2006, and 3.5% from 2006 to 
2007. 

 

 

 
2004, prior to the repatriation, but that increase is attributable to a single corporation which spent a 
relatively large amount during that period.47
   The line then levels out for a year before renewing 
its rise.

These graphs show that R&D expenditures did not appreciably increase beyond planned 

levels, and actually experienced a slight decrease in the rate of spending, after repatriation.    They 
stand in contrast to the graphs below tracking expenditures for stock repurchases and executive 
compensation, which demonstrate marked increases during the repatriation period.

Since the 2004 statute did not require corporations to document their use of repatriated 

funds, combined with the fungibility of dollars, it is not possible to determine the extent to which 
repatriated funds contributed to the corporations’ R&D spending during the period 2005 to 2007.   
When asked, the surveyed corporations did not provide the Subcommittee with any evidence 
demonstrating the extent to which repatriated funds were actually used to finance R&D 
expenditures or spur increased R&D spending.    The corporation that increased R&D expenditures 
the most among survey participants (77% from 2004-2007) reported to the Subcommittee that it 
“does not have data that estimates the amount of U.S. jobs or U.S. R&D expenditures that would 
have increased absent the enactment of section 965.”48
significant increases in its R&D expenditures during the covered period explained:    “We do not 
maintain data, and we have not made estimates, of how our U.S. jobs and U.S. research and 
development expenditures would have been different if amounts had not been repatriated under

section 965.”49    One corporation attributed its increased R&D spending in part to repatriated 
funds, though it was unable to explain how the repatriated funds boosted its spending.50

   

 
The Subcommittee’s survey data is consistent with academic research studies examining 
the 840 repatriating corporations as a whole.    Those studies generally concluded that there was no 
evidence that the 2004 AJCA repatriation led to increased R&D spending overall.    While in one 
survey tax executives from repatriating firms told researchers that their firms spent nearly 15% of 
their repatriated funds on R&D,51  other studies that did not rely on self-reporting by repatriating 
corporations, found no increase in R&D expenditures.    A 2009 study using National Bureau of 
Economic Research data, for example, concluded:    “[H]igher levels of repatriations were not 
associated with ... increased R&D expenditures.”52    Likewise, a 2009 study found no difference 
between the change in R&D between repatriating and non-repatriating corporations.53
 

      

3.  Stock Repurchases   

 
 
Federal regulations implementing the 2004 repatriation provisions explicitly prohibited 
using repatriated funds to pay for stock repurchases or dividends, determining that shareholder 
distributions were not a permitted use under the statute.54
    Yet subsequent research has shown a 
disturbing parallel between an increase in repatriated funds and an increase in share buybacks at 
the repatriating corporations. 
 

Stock repurchase programs enable a corporation to reacquire its own stock.    U.S. 

corporations may repurchase their own stock by distributing cash to existing shareholders in

753, 756 (June 2011).    As reported above, the study also states:    “The ability to access an internal source of capital at 
a lower cost did not boost domestic investment, employment, or R&D.”    Id., at 782.

distributions made by the taxpayer to its shareholders with respect to its stock, without regard to how such

regard to whether such redemption is treated as an exchange in part or full payment for the stock under section 302(b), 
is not a permitted investment.    As is the case with dividends, such expenditures do not constitute investments by the 
taxpayer for purposes of section 965”),

exchange for outstanding shares.    Corporations then typically either retire the shares or keep them 
as treasury stock available for re-issuance.   Corporations sometimes use repurchasing programs as 
a means to share corporate profits with shareholders.    In addition, by repurchasing its own stock 
and reducing the supply of shares available in the marketplace, a corporation can increase its 
earnings per share (EPS) and may be able to boost its stock  price.    Higher EPS values and stock 
prices provide greater value to shareholders.55
    They may also boost executive compensation by 
increasing the value of stock and stock options held by executives or by justifying larger executive 
bonuses.     
 

While stock repurchases benefit shareholders and executives, they reduce corporate cash 
holdings available for job growth, increased research and development expenditures, and capital 
investment.    The American Jobs Creation Act, as its name suggests, intended repatriated dollars 
to be used to increase U.S. employment; its legislative history contains no reference to using 
repatriated funds for share buybacks.    In addition, regulations under the law explicitly prohibit the 
use of repatriated funds to engage in share repurchases. The concern that corporations would use 
repatriated funds on stock repurchases to boost their EPS and stock price rather than increase jobs, 
research and development, or capital expenditures that would stimulate the economy, appears to 
have been well justified. 

 
Of the top 15 repatriating corporations, 12 or 80% of the corporations had increased their 
stock repurchases from 2004 through 2007, two had no stock repurchases, and one had decreased 
its repurchases.    The results indicate that the rate of stock repurchases accelerated after 
repatriation, decreasing 10% from 2002 to 2003, then increasing 13% from 2003 to 2004, 16% 
from 2004 to 2005, rising the most, 38%, from 2005 to 2006, and 9% from 2006 to 2007.   
Likewise, of the 19 corporations surveyed by the Subcommittee, 16 or 84% of the corporations had 
increased their stock repurchases; two had no stock repurchases; and one had decreased its stock 
repurchases from 2004 through 2007.56
    The survey data shows that stock repurchases went up at 
an increasing rate after repatriation compared to the years before repatriation, with the steepest 
increase occurring between 2005 and 2006.    Overall, as the chart below shows, in the years 
following the repatriation of offshore funds, the 19 surveyed corporations more than doubled the 
amount of their average stock repurchases, from about $2.2 billion in 2004 to $5.3 billion in 2007.   
 

                                                 
55  CRS notes that “[i]n addition to stock repurchases, increasing dividends are a way of returning money to 
shareholders.    Given the temporary nature of repatriation provisions, however, stock repurchases would be the 
expected vehicle to return money to shareholders, since they represent less of a commitment to ongoing distributions.@   
CRS Study, at 7, n. 15.                     
56  On average, for all 19 surveyed corporations, stock repurchases decreased 5% from 2002 to 2003, increased 6% 
from 2003 to 2004, 28% from 2004 to 2005, an additional 61% from 2005 to 2006, and an additional 17% from 2006 
to 2007.

correlation between the 2004 repatriation and an increase in stock buybacks.    A 2009 study using 
data from the National Bureau of Economic Research, for example, reported “that a $1 increase in 
repatriations was associated with an increase in payouts to shareholders of between $.60 and 
$0.92,” primarily through stock repurchases.57    Another economic study, known as the Clemons 
and Kinney study, which was reviewed by CRS, showed that “the only significant increase in

prohibited use of repatriated funds under the AJCA, because of the fungibility of money, firms that used part of the 
repatriation to repurchase shares may not have been in violation of the law.   

    A third study estimated

Although Section 965’s implementing regulations prohibited the use of repatriated funds 

 
that, in 2005 alone, repatriating corporations increased stock repurchases by approximately $61 
billion.59    A fourth study, conducted by surveying tax executives at the repatriating corporations, 
found that 40% of the repatriating corporations reported having used cash that was freed up by 
repatriated dollars to repurchase shares.60
 
 
on stock repurchases, corporations could have technically adhered to the law by spending 
repatriated dollars in budgeted areas allowed under the AJCA, and then using money that the 
repatriated sums freed up to repurchase shares.61
    In that case, corporations essentially distributed 
a portion of the repatriated offshore funds to their shareholders, without technically violating the 
law, but also making the repatriated cash unavailable for use in domestic job growth, R&D efforts, 
or other investments.    Increased spending on stock repurchases violated the spirit of the law by 
directing the stream of repatriated funds to augment shareholder wealth, and likely executive 
wealth, instead of putting the funds toward Congressional priorities, such as hiring workers or 
increasing R&D spending.    The research indicates that executives and shareholders got the 
benefit of the bargain in the AJCA at the expense of the overall economy. 
 

4.  Executive Compensation   

 
Under the AJCA, use of repatriated funds to increase executive compensation was 

explicitly prohibited, however, all but one of the corporations that the Subcommittee surveyed62
 
increased executive compensation from 2004 to 2007, in particular by increasing stock awards to 
senior executives.    The fungibility of dollars and the law’s failure to require corporate records 
tracing the use of repatriated funds make it difficult to determine the extent to which repatriated 
dividends, or funds freed up by repatriated dividends, contributed to the increase in executive pay.   
However, the empirical trends in repatriated funds and executive compensation show troubling 
parallels.         

 
Overall, from 2002 to 2007, according to data supplied by the corporations, compensation 
for the top five corporate executives at the top 15 repatriating corporations increased the most after 
corporations repatriated offshore funds.63
   From 2002 to 2003, executive compensation at those

conduct.    On the same day that Starwood approved a $1 billion stock repurchase plan, it announced it was repatriating 
$550 million.    Its spokeswoman, Alisa Rosenberg, stated:    “But what (the act) does is it brings money over to be 
used for those types of things, which frees up money that would have been used for hiring and training.”    See Roy

firms decreased 9%, then increased 14% from 2003 to 2004, increased 27% from 2004 to 2005, 
increased the most, 30%, from 2005 to 2006, and increased 2% from 2006 to 2007.    The trends for 
the 19 corporations surveyed by the Subcommittee were similar:    executive compensation 
decreased 15% from 2002 to 2003, increased 14% from 2003 to 2004, increased 15% from 2004 to 
2005, increased 35% from 2005 to 2006, and decreased 0.6% from 2006 to 2007.    The 35% 
increase for the 19 surveyed corporations meant that, from 2005 to 2006, compensation for the top 
five executives collectively jumped from $36 million to $49 million in a single year.64    In 
contrast, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, from 2002 to 2007, average worker pay 
in the United States increased only 5% each year on average.65

As part of the increased compensation, the most senior executives at the repatriating 

corporations benefitted from an increase in restricted stock awards in the year following the AJCA.   
Some of those awards represented significant increases.   

 
In the two years following the AJCA, the top 15 repatriating companies made substantial 
restricted stock awards to senior executives, as shown in the table below.    Senior executives at 
nine companies (Merck, Hewlett Packard, Johnson & Johnson, Schering-Plough, Bristol-Myers, 
Eli Lilly, PepsiCo, Altria, and Procter & Gamble) received restricted stock awards of more than $1 
million in 2005, while senior executives at ten companies (Pfizer, Merck, Hewlett Packard, 
Johnson & Johnson, Schering-Plough, Eli Lilly, DuPont, Pepsico, Altria, and Procter & Gamble) 
received restricted stock awards of more than $1 million in 2006.    The CEO and President of 
Hewlett Packard received restricted stock awards valued at more than $8.6 million in 2005 and 
$4.7 million in 2006; the Chairman and CEO of Schering-Plough received restricted stock awards 
valued at more than $4.1 million in 2005 and $10.2 million in 2006; the Chairman and CEO of 
PepsiCo received restricted stock awards valued at more than $4.9 million in 2005 and $6.2 
million in 2006; and the Chairman and CEO of Altria received restricted stock awards valued at

repatriating corporations’ senior executives was likely further increased by the corporations’ 
substantial stock repurchases, as explained above.     
 
 
repurchases and executive compensation climbed at the largest repatriating corporations, while 
hiring stagnated or declined.    This finding was not replicated, however, in research that examined 
                                                 
67  The two corporations that did not increase executive stock awards in 2005 or 2006 were Bristol-Myers and 
Cola-Cola.    Coca-Cola’s totals in 2006 include portions of prior year awards, so the new awards in 2006 did not 
exceed 2004 levels.   

Together, this data indicates that, as funds were repatriated to the United States, stock 

 

 

28 

 
all 843 repatriating corporations; that research did not find a significant association overall 
between repatriation and increased executive compensation when considering data from the larger 
group.68
    The Subcommittee’s survey results apply only to the 19 surveyed corporations which, 
together, brought back more than half of all the repatriated foreign earnings. 
 

 

5.  Industry Sectors Benefiting from Repatriation 

 

Analysis shows that the 2004 repatriation turned out to benefit only a narrow sector of U.S. 

multinational corporations.    Altogether, 843 corporations, or 11.5% of the roughly 9,700 U.S. 
corporations with controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) in 2004, took advantage of the 
deduction.69    Those 843 corporations represented only 0.015% of the 5,557,965 corporations that 
filed U.S. tax returns in 2004, many of which had no international operations.70    Of the $312 
billion in qualifying funds that were repatriated, IRS data indicates that $157 billion, or half, went 
to multinational corporations in just two industry sectors, the pharmaceutical and technology 
industries.71

     

 
IRS data indicates that, of the 843 filers that took advantage of the deduction, 

pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing corporations comprised about 3% of the total, yet 
claimed almost one-third of the qualifying dividends.    Altogether, the pharmaceutical industry 
repatriated nearly $106 billion and deducted $98.8 billion.72    The computer and electronic 
equipment manufacturing industry represented about 10% of the 843 filers, yet repatriated about 
$57.5 billion, or 18% of the total qualifying dividends.73

 
 
The predominance of the pharmaceutical and technology industries among all repatriating 
corporations was reflected in the Subcommittee’s survey, as shown in the chart below, broken out 
by the top 15 repatriating corporations.    Of those top 15 repatriating corporations, all of which 
were surveyed by the Subcommittee, six were pharmaceutical74  and four were technology 
corporations.75

Because the repatriation tax break benefits only U.S. corporations with substantial offshore 

funds, the 2004 AJCA repatriation provision has been the subject of criticism by a number of 
domestic and small businesses.76
    A coalition that includes several small business groups, for 
example, opposes repatriation as an unfair tax benefit, explaining in a recent letter to Congress: 
                                                 
76  See, e.g., “Offshore tax dodging hurts U.S. business,” an opinion piece by Paul Egerman, a small business owner 
who started two health information technology companies, Michigan Midland Daily News (6/7/2011), Report Exhibit 
10, (“As a businessman and entrepreneur, I believe it is myopic tax policy to force domestic enterprises to compete on 
an unlevel playing field against companies that use offshore tax havens to relocate profits. …    And now, a coalition of 
global corporations is calling for a tax holiday so they can bring home over $1 trillion [in] profits that they parked 
offshore without paying the same corporate income rate that most domestic companies pay.    Congress’ Joint 
Committee on Taxation estimates this move would cost the U.S. $80 billion over ten years.    …    There are millions of 
U.S. business people in this country who work extremely hard to reach customers, provide better services, build better 
widgets – and pay their local, state and federal taxes. …    The bills have to be paid – and no one should be able to opt 
out simply because they are politically connected and big.”); “A Charlie Brown Congress?” an opinion piece by Frank 
Knapp, Jr., President and CEO of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, The Hill (6/29/2011), 
Report Exhibit 11, (“Giving U.S. multinational corporations another ‘repatriation tax holiday’ will encourage them to 
shift even more of their profits into offshore tax havens .…    As a result, our country’s deficit will increase when an 
estimated $79 billion more in corporate taxes is not collected over the next 10 years according to Congress’s Joint 

30 

 
“When powerful large U.S. corporations avoid their fair share of taxes, they undermine 
U.S. competitiveness, contribute to the national debt and shift more of the tax burden to 
domestic businesses, especially small businesses that create most of the new jobs.    A 
transparent corporate tax system that assures all companies – large and small – pay for the 
services upon which our businesses, our customers, our workforce and our communities 
depend, would help restore the economic vitality and domestic job creation we all seek.”77
 
  Even some multinational corporations, such as IBM,78 Caterpillar

 Inc., Kimberly-Clark 
Corp., United Technologies Corp. and Zimmer Holdings Inc., have expressed a lack of support for 
a new repatriation effort.79

     

 

 

 
According to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, Timothy Geithner, 96% of U.S. 

corporations would not benefit from a new repatriation tax break.80

 

 

6.  Source of Repatriated Funds 

 

 

   Of the 19 corporations surveyed, 

 
The data collected by the Subcommittee survey shows that a significant amount of the 

 
 
repatriated funds under Section 965 flowed from tax haven jurisdictions, including the Bahamas, 
Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Costa Rica, Hong Kong, Ireland, Luxembourg, 
Netherlands Antilles, Panama, Singapore, and Switzerland.81
seven or 37% repatriated between 90 and 100% of funds from tax haven jurisdictions, as indicated 
in the following chart.   
 
                                                                                                                                                             
Committee on Taxation.    That means the rest of us will continue to pay more than our fair share for the essential 
services of government.    These big corporations benefit immensely from all the advantages of being headquartered in 
our country.    They need to start paying their taxes just as every citizen and small business does.”).

The Subcommittee followed up with several corporations to determine if the tax haven 

 
Of the remaining 12 corporations surveyed by the Subcommittee, five repatriated from 70% to 
89% of their funds from tax havens; three repatriated between 30 and 69% of their funds from tax 
havens; two repatriated around 7%; and two repatriated less than 1%.82
 
 
subsidiaries that were primarily responsible for repatriating these funds to the United States under 
Section 965 had any active operations.    Most of the corporations told the Subcommittee that their 
tax haven subsidiaries that repatriated funds were holding companies designed primarily to hold 
funds or facilitate the movement of funds among a network of foreign subsidiaries.    A number of 
those tax haven subsidiaries had no physical office and few or no full time employees in the tax 
haven jurisdiction. 
 
 
qualifying dividends from tax haven subsidiaries which had no apparent active business 
operations, such as a manufacturing plant.    In each case, the repatriating tax haven subsidiary 
transferred billions of dollars to the United States. 
 

The following corporations, for example, repatriated between 70% and 100% of their 

•  Coca-Cola repatriated nearly all of its qualifying dividends from a Cayman Island 

subsidiary which had no Cayman employees and functioned primarily, in the words of 
Coca-Cola, to fund its offshore operations and “provide[ ] legal insulation” for its U.S. 
assets.   

•  Eli Lilly repatriated most of its qualifying dividends from a holding company which was 
located in Switzerland and employed 86 employees among itself and 12 subsidiaries.    The 
remaining portion of its qualifying dividends was repatriated from an investment holding 
company which had no employees and was located in the British Virgin Islands.

Intel repatriated most of its qualifying dividends from a Cayman corporation that had no 
physical office and, according to Intel, “helped reduce the Irish tax on manufacturing 
operations in Ireland” and facilitated the flow of funds among its other offshore 
subsidiaries.     

•  Oracle repatriated nearly all of its qualified dividends from an Irish subsidiary which had 

no physical office and was designed, in the words of Oracle, to “[f]acilitate business 
operations outside of the U.S.”    Although the Irish company itself had no office and no 
full time employees in the jurisdiction, the four subsidiaries under it had a total of 500 
employees.     

•  PepsiCo repatriated most of its qualifying dividends from a holding and finance company 
located in Bermuda with a single full time employee.    According to PepsiCo, the Bermuda 
holding company held and managed funds generated by a network of its other international 
subsidiaries.   

•  Proctor & Gamble repatriated nearly all of its qualifying dividends from a Bermuda 

holding company that had no physical office and no full time employees in Bermuda.    The 
holding company was located in Bermuda because, according to Proctor & Gamble, it was 
“[n]ot typically advantageous for a company to operate its non-U.S. businesses directly 
through U.S. subs because the deferral of U.S. taxes on non-U.S. source income permitted 
under U.S. law would thereby be unnecessarily terminated.” 

 
The Subcommittee’s survey results are consistent with other research examining the 2004 
AJCA repatriation.    As one academic concluded after analyzing confidential corporate data from 
the Bureau of Economic Analysis, “[T]he largest tax savings from the DRD [Dividends Received 
Deduction] accrued primarily to countries categorized as tax havens.”83   Likewise, the 2010 CRS 
study found that, overall, across all 843 repatriating corporations, repatriated funds were heavily 
concentrated in low tax countries or tax havens.84    An IRS study stated, as reflected in Figure F 
from the study, reprinted below:    “Firms can be expected to park considerable shares of their 
earnings and profits in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the 
Cayman Islands, as these countries are known for their favorable tax policies.”85

After examining the controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) that were the source of 

repatriated funds for U.S. affiliates, the IRS study determined that, overall, the CFCs incorporated 
in Europe were responsible for 62% of the total repatriated cash dividends.86    Of those European 
CFCs, the IRS found that CFCs incorporated in the Netherlands represented 6% of the CFCs 
overall, but 26% of the cash dividends.    The IRS study also determined that the next most popular 
source of repatriated funds were CFCs incorporated in Switzerland, Bermuda, Ireland, Canada, 
Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, and the Cayman Islands.87

   

 

Data indicates that, since the 2004 AJCA repatriation, most corporations that repatriated 

 
substantial sums under that law have built up their offshore funds at an even greater rate than 
before the AJCA.88    According to one study, the rapid, post-ACJA accumulation of offshore 
funds by U.S. multinationals indicates that the AJCA repatriation “may have encouraged more 
shifting of profits than usual in preparation for another repatriation tax holiday.”89

The possibility of a repeat repatriation tax break provides U.S. multinational corporations 

with an incentive to move more jobs, operations, and investments abroad, and keep substantial 
funds offshore, in order to take advantage of the next opportunity to bring corporate profits back to 
the United States at an extremely low tax rate.    The empirical evidence indicates that corporations 
will benefit even more than before if another repatriation tax break occurs.     

 
Data collected by the Subcommittee, as reflected in the following chart, shows that the ten 
corporations that repatriated the most money under the AJCA have, with one exception (Pfizer), 
stockpiled increasing amounts of offshore funds every year since taking advantage of the 2004 
provision.    The same pattern is evident among the remaining ten of the 19 corporations surveyed 
by the Subcommittee, again with one exception (Motorola).90
    Merck, for example, has reported 
accumulated undistributed foreign earnings in the years following the AJCA (2006 to 2010) 
totaling $40.4 billion.    In a comparable time period prior to enactment of the AJCA (2000 to 
2004), by comparison, Merck reported half that amount, with accumulated undistributed foreign 
earnings of $20.1 billion.

The Subcommittee’s survey results are consistent with other research.    The 2011 CRS 
study, for example, found that, across all U.S. corporations, unrepatriated offshore funds have 
grown rapidly since 2005,91  increasing since the 2004 repatriation by 72% for all corporations and 
by 81% for firms that repatriated under the AJCA.92
 
 
that since the AJCA provision: 
 

A 2010 study by Professor Thomas J. Brennan reached a similar conclusion.93

    It found 

         

“there has been a dramatic increase in the rate at which firms add to their stockpile of 
foreign earnings kept overseas.    The long-term result has been an aggregate increase in 
new foreign earnings added to the overseas stockpile that is greater than the amount of 
funds repatriated [under the 2004 AJCA].@94

   

 

 

Because the stockpiles of offshore funds have continued to increase and currently outweigh the 
amount of funds repatriated under the AJCA, the Brennan study stated that “[t]he AJCA may have 
been a net failure in achieving the policy goal of returning foreign earnings to the United States.”95  
It also stated that a Acollateral consequence@ of the AJCA provision was Athe conditioning of firms 
to expect future such holidays and to arrange their affairs accordingly.@96
findings demonstrated only a statistical correlation and not causation, the Brennan study 
concluded:   
 

    While noting that its 

“[T]he changes in patterns demonstrated [by the study] are sufficiently substantial in terms 
of dollar magnitude and statistical significance that they provide strong evidence of a 
conditioned behavioral change in firms created by the AJCA tax holiday.”97

     

The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), whose tax expertise guides Congress, has also 

 
determined that the 2004 AJCA repatriation tax break has encouraged corporations to move funds 
offshore.    In an April 2011 letter, JCT wrote that “it is also necessary to recognize that ... section 
965 ... prospectively [ ] encourages investments and/or earnings to be located overseas.”98
    JCT 
predicted that another repatriation tax break would make offshore locales even more attractive to 
U.S. corporations seeking to take advantage of extremely low corporate income tax rates.    Due to

its analysis that the effect of a repeat repatriation tax break would be to encourage corporations to 
move still more investments and funds offshore, when asked to estimate the cost of a repeat 
repatriation tax break, JCT calculated the total cost to the U.S. treasury in lost tax revenues over 
ten years would be $78.7 billion, assuming an 85% decrease in the tax rate.99    For an alternative 
plan, assuming a 70% rate decrease were enacted, JCT calculated that the cost would be $41.7 
billion over ten years.100
 

  

 

8.  Current Domestic Cash Assets 

 
Proponents of the 2004 repatriation tax break touted increased investment capital as one of 
 
the economic benefits of repatriation.    The rationale was that money brought back to this country 
through repatriation and deposited in U.S. banks would provide increased funds to corporations for 
use in U.S. jobs and domestic investments.    Research has since demonstrated, however, that many 
corporations did not use their repatriated funds for domestic investment, and some even returned 
the repatriated funds – after taking advantage of the extraordinarily low tax rate of 5.25% – to their 
offshore operations, which indicates they did not need the offshore funds for domestic use.   
Today, with U.S. corporations collectively holding even more abundant domestic cash assets in 
2011 than in 2004, returning offshore cash to spur U.S. job growth and domestic investment offers 
an even less persuasive rationale to justify an expensive tax expenditure. 
 
One recent study used Bureau of Economic Analysis data to review the relationship 
 
between AJCA repatriations and U.S. parent company infusions of cash into their offshore 
affiliates.101    The study found a “significantly different” pattern in 2005 compared to other years 
studied, determining that U.S. corporations that repatriated $259 billion in 2005 also sent $104 
billion to their offshore affiliates during the same period.102    Since 2005 was the year that most 
corporations (86%) reported a repatriation tax deduction,103  the study concluded that some U.S. 
parent corporations repatriated funds to take advantage of the lower tax rate, but then immediately 
returned the funds offshore, an action which it termed “round tripping.”104
presented data suggesting that some U.S. parent corporations may have sent domestic funds to 
                                                 
99 Id., at 2.    JCT indicated that increased offshoring of funds was one of three major components underlying the cost 
of another repatriation tax break, which JCT calculated would be $78.7 billion over ten years if an 85% decrease in the 
tax rate were enacted as occurred in 2004, or $41.7 billion over ten years if a 70% rate decrease were enacted instead.   
See also id. at 4 (“The final component of the estimates takes account of how each proposal would affect the 
prospective decisions of taxpayers about where to locate investment and/or income.    . . .    [E]ase of repatriation is one 
consideration in such decisions, and enactment of section 965 would be regarded by some taxpayers as altering the 
existing geographic location incentives.”).

time of the HIA, repatriations were positively associated with parents sending capital to their foreign affiliates, 
suggesting that parent companies were round tripping capital in order to repatriate it at the lower tax rate.”). 

    Another study 

 

38 

U.S. parent corporations have even less need for offshore cash today.    The Federal 

 
their offshore affiliates in advance of repatriation simply to take advantage of the 5.25% tax rate 
when the funds were subsequently returned.105
    In this form of round tripping, the U.S. parent 
corporation apparently repatriated funds that were already intended for domestic use.    In both 
studies, the repatriating corporations apparently did not need offshore funds for domestic 
investments.    Just as the 2004 repatriation led to corporations shifting foreign earnings offshore, 
the prospect of a repeat repatriation tax break raises the concern that corporations would again 
employ round tripping tactics to lower their tax bills without providing commensurate benefits 
through increased U.S. jobs or investment. 
 
 
Reserve Board has estimated that through the second quarter of 2011, the most recent period for 
which such data is available, U.S. corporations have domestic cash holdings of over $2 trillion.106 
The corporations that have the greatest domestic cash holdings are in the pharmaceutical and 
technology industries, the same industries advocating for another offshore tax break.    In a recent 
survey of corporate cash holdings by different industries, for example, researchers analyzed the 
amount of cash in excess of what corporations needed to satisfy their contractual obligations:    “Of 
the 138 companies with cash cushions of more than two years, 58 of them or 42% are in the 
Technology sector and 27 or 20% are from the Health Care sector.”107    By one estimate, ten of 
these corporations – Adobe Systems, Apple, CA Technologies, Cisco, Duke Energy, Google, 
Microsoft, Oracle, Pfizer, and Qualcomm – collectively have at least $47 billion in cash and liquid 
assets available for domestic investments, without incurring additional tax liability.108
 
 
Given these large cash holdings, the claim that a rate reduction on repatriated earnings will 
generate increased domestic investment Aholds no water at all,@ according to Joel B. Slemrod, an 
economics professor at the University of Michigan and former senior tax counsel for President 
Reagan=s Council of Economic Advisors.    Professor Slemrod stated:    “The fact that they have 
these cash hoards suggests that investment is not being constrained by lack of cash.”109

9.  2004 Repatriation Did Not Achieve Intended Stimulus Effect   

 

Some supporters of the 2004 AJCA repatriation tax break contend that the repatriated 

funds had a stimulus effect on the U.S. economy, resulting in more jobs and domestic investment, 
but are unable to cite persuasive research to support those claims.     

 
One study cited by some repatriation supporters to support a new round of repatriation tax 

Critics of the Sinai study have noted several problems with its projections.113

breaks is a November 2008 study by economist Allen Sinai.110    This study did not, however, 
examine actual economic data resulting from the 2004 repatriation; instead it used 
computer-generated economic simulations of repatriation provisions similar to those in AJCA to 
project the economic impact if a new repatriation tax break were to be enacted in 2009.    Based on 
such simulations, the Sinai study concluded that a 2009 repatriation tax break would have 
improved the net cash flow of participating corporations by approximately $535 billion.111    It also 
projected that a temporary reduction in the tax on repatriated funds would have increased domestic 
economic activity in the 2009 - 2013 time period, estimating that gross domestic product (GDP) 
would have increased by an average of $62 billion per year, and business capital spending and 
research and development by an average of $7 billion per year.    The Sinai study also projected an 
increase in employment, peaking at 614,000 additional jobs in 2011.112
 
 
have noted that the study relied on computer simulations rather than actual economic data to 
conduct its analysis.    Second, they have observed that the assumptions underlying the 2008 Sinai 
simulation model did not incorporate detailed economic data from the 2004 repatriation.    The 
absence of actual data on the impact of the 2004 repatriation on U.S. employment and economic 
activity, as documented by the 2010 CRS report and other independent studies, to calibrate the 
Sinai simulation model necessarily limits its predictive capabilities.    Third, the economic 
conditions in effect when the simulations were run, which took place at the height of the 2008 
financial crisis, differ markedly from current conditions, as recently noted by Mr. Sinai himself.     
 
 
second repatriation tax break was less compelling when, instead of facing credit and cash flow 
problems, U.S. corporations have large cash holdings.    According to Mr. Sinai:    “The case for it 
[repatriation] is not as strong because corporations are so cash rich.”114

In fact, when recently asked about his 2008 study, Mr. Sinai noted that the rationale for a

“Many who want this policy try to advocate it as a jobs-creation program, but that is not 
what I found.    …    What I found was that it would shore up the corporate balance sheets 
during the depths of the financial crisis and create some jobs.    But the balance sheets are 
already so good that I don’t think there’s a rationale any longer that simply rebuilding the 
companies’ finances will lead to hiring.”115

. 

The probability of Sinai’s findings are further called into question by more recent research 
that uses actual economic data on the results of the 2004 repatriation rather than Sinai’s computer 
simulations to reach its conclusions.    For example, after reviewing detailed data from the 2004 
repatriation, the 2010 CRS study concluded:     

 
“While the empirical evidence is clear that this provision resulted in a significant increase 
in repatriated earnings, empirical evidence is unable to show a corresponding increase in 
domestic investment or employment by firms that utilized the repatriation provisions.”     
 

In reaching this conclusion, CRS cited several empirical studies including, as indicated earlier, the 
Dharmapala study which concluded that repatriation had a statistically insignificant impact on 
domestic capital expenditures and jobs;116  and the Clemons and Kinney study which found no 
evidence that investment increased in corporations that utilized the 2004 repatriation provisions.117
CRS wrote: 

   

 
“Empirical analyses of the stimulative effects of the repatriation provisions in the 
American Jobs Creation Act also suggests a limited stimulative impact from these 
provisions.    They conclude that much of the repatriated earnings were used for cash-flow 
purposes and little evidence exists that new investment was spurred.”118
 

   

 

 

 

This Report’s survey results are consistent with that research.

B.  Conclusion 
 
The Domestic Reinvestment Plans produced by the corporations that repatriated offshore 

funds under the AJCA describe how each planned to expend repatriated funds on hiring and 
training new employees.    But the reality was that, instead of increasing jobs, the top 15 
repatriators did not increase their U.S. workforces or their research and development expenditures 
overall, even after bringing back over $150 billion in offshore dollars subject to an extraordinarily 
low tax rate.    At the same time, at those same corporations, stock repurchases and executive 
compensation climbed.    These trends show that the 2004 repatriation not only failed to achieve its 
goal of increasing jobs and domestic investment in research and development, it did little more 
than enrich corporate shareholders and executives while providing an estimated $3.3 billion tax 
windfall for some of the largest multinational corporations.    In addition, because Congress did not 
require corporations that took advantage of the tax break to track how repatriated funds were used, 
it left the U.S. Treasury without a mechanism to measure compliance or prevent misuse of the 
repatriated funds.       

 
Even more disturbing is that the 2004 repatriation rewarded corporations that kept 

substantial funds offshore, and has created a new incentive for U.S. corporations to keep shipping 
jobs and diverting domestic funds offshore.    Data shows that the 2004 repatriated funds flowed 
largely from tax havens, rewarding corporate behavior that moved funds to offshore locales rather 
than U.S. plants or manufacturing.    The long term consequence of that policy is the current 
corporate stockpiling of offshore funds in anticipation of another repatriation tax break allowing 
multinational corporations to use a 5.25% tax rate in place of the top 35% rate that applies to 
domestic corporations.    Such disparate tax rates punish small and mid-sized domestic 
corporations that don’t do business offshore, by placing them at a competitive disadvantage, 
allowing their competitors to escape paying their fair share of taxes, and discouraging 
multinational corporations from investing in America.    The AJCA’s negative effects, in both the 
short and long-term, provide strong evidence that repatriation tax breaks create unfair tax 
advantages for a narrow sector of corporations with damaging economic impacts on the U.S. 
economy as a whole.

JOINT COMM ITIEE ON TAXATION 
Wlaooington,  lJlQi;  20515-6453 

UPRJS  2011 

Honorable Lloyd Doggett 
U.S.  House of Representatives 
20 I Cannon House Office Building 
Washington, D.C.  20515 

Dear Mr. Doggett: 

This is in response to your request of March 23, 2011, for revenue estimates of two 

proposals to modify section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"). 

Description of the Proposals and Revenue Estimates 

Section 965 provides an elective, temporary, 85-percent dividends-received deduction 

("DRD") for certain dividends received by a domestic corporation from controlled foreign 
corporations, subject to a nwnber of conditions and limitations.  Included in these limitations are 
requirements that eligible dividends are:  (1) in excess of a specified level of historical average 
repatriation; (2) no more than the greater of$500 million or  the amount of overseas earnings 
identified for financial accoWlting purposes as pClTI1anently reinvested earnings ("PRE," which is 
discussed in detail below); and (3) reinvested in the United States pursuant to a dividend 
reinvestment plan  approved by the management and board of directors of the electing 
corporation and meeting certain other criteria.  An election under section 965 was available only 
for either the taxpayer's (i) last taxable year beginning before the date of enactment of section 
965  (which was October 22, 2004) or (ii) first taxable year beginning during the onc-year period 
beginning on such date of enactment. 

It is assumed that your re~pec-tive proposals would pennit an election under se,ction 965 

for the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2010, with appropriate 
changes to other dates and provisions necessary to adhere to the intent of section 965.  The first 
proposal retains the 85-percent DRD already in section 965, while the second proposal permits a 
70-pereent DRD.! 

1 The 85-percent DRD results in a 5.25 percent U.S. tax rate (0.15  multiplied by the top statutory corporate rate of 
35 percent) on the entire repatriation before taking account of foreign tax credits and expense disallowance, wbile a 
70-percent DRD translates into  10.5  percent U.S.  (0.30 muhiplied by the top statutory corporate rate of 35  percent) 
tax ratc before such items are taken into account.

Ex~:Ianation of the R~venue Estimates 

Our revenue estimates of these modifications of section 965 draw from the evidence on 

usage of section 965 in the 2004·2006 period. as well as evidence from other temporary 
reductions or holidays in areas such as sales taxation and the taxation of capital gain income. 

Each estimate includes three major components. 2  The first and smallest component 
involves the tax reduction afforded Wlder s~ction 965 for certain dividends that taxpayers are 
predicted to repatriate in the budget period tmder present law even in the absence of enactment of 
the proposal.3  For taxpayers that are predicted to be repatriating these dividends in years 2011 

2 Details on our estimating approach to the original enactment of section 965 can be fOlllld  in  Edward D. Kleinbard 
and Patrick A.  Driessen, "A Revenue Estimate Case Study;  The Repatriation  Holiday Revisited," Tax Notes, 
September 22, 2008, pp.  1191-1202. 

3 Over the last two decades except for the years affected by the enactment of the original section 965, annual 
dividend repatriations have ranged from $50 to $100 billion, and these repatriations tend to mix with other types of 
foreign source income, so it is difficult to measure U.S. residual tax on repatriated dividends alone.  Because we 
assume present law for establishing baseline revenues for the purpose of evaluating the revenue effects of each 
proposal, it is assumed that the provisions in the Code permitting the deferral of earnings from certain financial 
activities under sections 953 and 954 of the Code, and the "look through" of cenain payments between related 
panies for the purpose of detcnnining eligibility for deferral under seerion 954(c) (6). are not extended past their 
expiration dates in 2012.

and 2012 notwithstanding the proposals, the extent to which taxpayers elect section 965 is a U.S. 
tax "windfall" for them that reduces U.S. tax receipts. 

The second major component of each estimate captures the U.S. tax effects associated 
with taxpayers changing their dividend repatriation amowlts andlor timing in response to each 
proposal.  Taxpayers would accelerate the repatriation of dividends to qUalifY for section 965: 
some of these dividends would be accelerated from within the budget period," say from 2013 or 
2015 into 2011, and other accelerated dividends qualifying for section 965 would not otherwise 
be repatriated in the budget period (nor perhaps for many years after that).  There are several 
ways that these altered dividend payments affect U.S. tax receipts. First, dividends qualifying for 
section 965 would be 85-percent (or 70-percent) exempt, with foreign tax credits still permitted 
for the non-exempt portion. For example, a taxpayer may pay $4 of U.S. tax under the 85-percent 
DRD proposal or alternatively $8 of U.S. tax under the 70-percent DRD proposal (after 
accounting in each case for foreign tax credit and any expense disallowance required by section 
965) on a $100 dividend in 2011  that, absent qualifying for section 965, would not have been 
repatriated in the 2011-2021  period.s Second, any dividend that is accelerated to qualify for 
section 965, but which would have otherwise been repatriated later in the budget period after 
section 965 expires, would avoid poteI?-tial residual U.S. tax that would have been paid in the 

~ Dividend payments from CFCs to related U.S. persons could also be delayed if there is a legislative window 
Jeading to an announcement effect that pennits taxpayers to delay repatriation to maximize exemption under section 
965. 

, After the enactment of section 965 in 2004, there was  interest in, and some confusion about, the U.S. tax receipts 
associated with the dividends qualifying for section 965.  The 85-percent DRD enacted in 2004 translated into a 5.25 
percent nominal U.S. tax rate on qualifying dividends.  However, foreign tax credits are permitted against the non(cid:173)
exempt portion of qualifying dividends, and there may be some expense disallowance requiring the denial of certain 
domestic tax deductions.  The data presented by Melissa Redmiles, "The One-Time Received Dividend Deduction," 
IRS Statistjcs of Income Bulletjn, 27:4 (Spring 2008), pp.1 02-14,  suggests that the applicable residual U.S. tax rate, 
or initial "toll charge," on  all  qualifying dividends after accounting for these other factors was somewhat below four 
percent.  As suggested above, this toll charge is just one part of the estimate, because the source of the qualifying 
dividends has to be accounted for along with the change in potential tax receipts associated with the projected 
present law counterfactual activity as  described below,  and other taxpayer behavior that is not captured by the 
acceleration of repatriated dividends to quality for section 965 must be accounted for.

absence of section 965. 6  For example. a $1 00 dividend that would have been repatriated under 
present law in 2013, and would have resulted in a $25 U.S. residual tax at that time, would now 
instead incur $4 in U.s. tax under"the 8S-percent DRD proposal as it qualifies for section 965 in 
2011.  In addition, the uses by U.S. firms of the dividend payments that were induced or 
accelerated by section 965  would change the U.s. tax base.  For example, a company may 
increase its dividend as a result of section 965, and as a result shareholders may be liable for 
additional individual taxes.7 

The final component of the estimates takes account of bow each proposal would affect 

the prospective decisions of taxpayers about where to locate investment and/or income.  As 
discussed below, ease of repatriation is one consideration in such decisions, and enactment of 
section 965 would be regarded by some taxpayers as altering the existing geographic location 
incentives. If firms anticipate that future repatriation of foreign earnings to meet such needs 
could occur with little U.S. residual taxation, finns would be less constrained in their location 
decisions, and that behavioral effect of section 965 also is accounted for in the revenue estimates 
of your proposals.8 

To swnmarize, the revenue estimates consider the U.S. tax implications of how each 

proposal:  (1) affects repatriations that will occur under present law with no assumed change in 
amount or timing; (2) causes the acceleration of repatriated dividends from both outside and 
inside the 2011 -2021  budget period in order to qualify for section 965; (3) affects the recognition 

6  As we discuss below, we expect that these rep'atriations will increase under the present law baseline during the 
fIScal year 2011-2021  period because of the tension between domestic needs and the growing stock of deferred 
overseas income. 

7 These tax base effects owing to the uses of repatriated funds depend upon whether funds would not have been 
repatriated in the budget period without section 965, as, for example, these tax base effects can be accelerated in thc 
same ways that repatriated dividends can be accelerated.  In addition, shareholders who receive an increased 
dividend, or have their stock repurchased, have discretion in managing their portfolios to achieve their own cash and 
investment needs.  For example, an investor whose shares are bought back by Company A duc to section 965 
activity may respond by not selling his equity shares in Company 8  as he would have before Company A's share 
repurchase. In  addition, it is difficuh to dctcnninc what share repurchases or dividend increases would happen in the 
absence of section 965, as some companies would proceed with these activities by finding funding elsewhere.

source income, and as such the term is not restricted to the conventional notion of brick-and-mortar invesnnent.

for U.S. tax pwposes of certain types of income as a result of projections of how companies will 
use qualified repatriations; and (4) changes the prospective  investment and income location 
decisions by companies. 

In preparing these estimates, we have examined the last two decades' tax, accounting, 

and other economic data with respect to investment location decisions of U.S.-based 
multinationals, deferral of foreign somec income, and financial reporting decisions.  The trend 
towards overseas location of highly profitable investment (some of it associated with the transfer 
or development of intangibles) continues,9 as does the deferral and accwnulation of foreign 
earnings (with the exception of the short-tenn drawdoml of that accumulation caused by the 
enactment of section 965  in 2004).  Some of this high overseas profitability is related to overseas 
marketing and production opportunities aimed at sales to third parties located overseas which is 
part ofa secular movement that has been underway for many decades,lo while some of it can be 
linked to U.S.-based activities such as research and development or third-party demand in the 
U.S.  market. 

It is clear that companies have some latitude with respect to prospective location 
decisions. Changes over the last two decades in Treasury Departtnent regulations (some 
favorable to overseas investment, e.g., the check-the-box regulations in the  1990s, and some at 
least potentially restrictive on overseas investment, such as the recent cost sharing regulations 
addressing transfer pricing methodologies and the subpart F contract manufacturing 
regulations)ll  and the Code (e.g., the subpart F exception for active financing income which has 
been available over the last  15 years, and the provision in the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 
2005 that allows taxpayers to avoid generating subpart F income from payments between related 
parties, known as the "CFC look through'') have on balance facilitated the deferral of foreign

source income and reduction in the foreign taxes paid on such income. Potential U.S. residual 
taxation, while no doubt inhibiting the repatriation of the stock of deferred overseas earnings, 
also affects the prospective location decisions affirms to the extent that fums anticipate the need 
for repatriation of foreign earnings, as the investment location decision is linked to the 
repatriation decision. 

Figure 1 summarizes the recent growth in deferral as context for evaluating the effects of 

your proposals.  While the usc of deferral has grown, companies continue to repatriate some 
dividends and as a result pay some residual U.S. tax in response to finn- or industry-specific 
cxigcncies. 12  There is  continuing demand for repatriation as the enactment of section 965 and 
subsequent interest in renewing section 965 have demonstrated. We expect repatriations to rise in 
the 2011 -2021  budget period under present law as  a result of the tension between domestic needs 
and the growth in the stock of deferred income. 

12  In recent years not affected by the original enactment of section 965, annual dividend repatriations have ranged 
from $50 to S100 billion.  The Government Accountability Office,  U.S.  Multinational Corporations:  Effective Tax 
Rates are Co"e/ated with  Where Income Is Reported, GA0-08·950. (August 2008), found that the residual U.S. tax 
rate on all foreign  source income, of which dividend repatriation comprises under 25  percent, was about four 
percent.  This aggregate average tax rate (which significantly is affected, for example, by "crosscrediting", which is 
the netting of foreign  taxes against fore ign  income across all foreign countries as pennitted by the Code in certain 
circumstances), likely understates the potential U.S.  tax collectible on marginal repatriations (which. for example, 
are less likely to be shielded from U.S. tax by cross-crediting).

Patterns in financial reporting also provide context for the revenue estimates, both 

technically (as a designation of permanently reinvested earnings, or PRE, is one way to qualify 
for exemption under section 965) and as a complement to the U.S. tax base changes presented 
above.  A PRE designation is a book accounting assertion by a taxpayer that it will not be 
repatriating certain earnings back to the United States in the foreseeable future.  This assertion 
often causes earnings for financial reporting to be larger than otherwise would be the case 
because after a PRE designation the taxpayer is not required to record the estimated U.S. tax 
charge that would accompany repatriation to the United States.  A disadvantage for companies of 
a PRE designation is that it makes repatriation of the designated funds more difficult.  The 
difficulty arises because a company that reverses a PRE designation reports to its shareholders a 
tax change reducing current year reported net income.  (There is no commensurate reported 
increase in reported income because the company previously reported such income to its 
shareholders).  Such a reversal may attract regulator and investor scrutiny. I )  While this 
accounting treatment creates a difficulty for the company's management, it does not make 
repatriation impossible.  A taxpayer can override a designation under certain circumstances. 14 
Taxpayers also have some flexibility in making PRE designations:  for example, previous PRE 
designations do not restrict taxpayers'  prospective choices about whether to  repatriate or reinvest 
earnings generated in the future. 

11  Because a company's auditor, in compliance with the U.S.  Generally Accepted ACCOWlting Principles ("GAAP"), 
is required to evaluate evidence compiled by management (as well as any other relevant evidence) regarding 
management's PRE assertion at each balance sheet date, a history of frequent PRE reversals may be considered 
negative evidence, thus hindering the auditor's approval of any future PRE assertions made by management with 
respect to its audited financial statements.  Moreover, such frequent reversals of PRE assertions could invite scrutiny 
from the Securities and  Exchange Commission ("SEC") because such reversals could be perceived as an attempt by 
management to manipulate its  U.S.  GAAP earnings through the  income tax expense line item in its profit and loss 
statement.  The result of such SEC scrutiny may be the  issuance of an SEC comment letter, the required restatement 
of the company's fmancials, or other possible sanction. 

14 For example, in 2009 Pfizer reversed its PRE assertion with respect to  $34 billion in earnings that it intended to 
repatriate as part of its acquisition of Wyeth ($20.6 billion of the funds had been so designated by Pfizer and 
approximately $13 .3 billion by Wyeth), according to Pfizer's filing ofFonn 8·K on October 21, 2009, and Wyeth's 
filing of its 2008 Form 100K on February 27, 2009. Although Wyeth disclosed that the residual U.S. tax on Wyeth's 
historic PRE was $2.7 billion or 20.3  percent ($2.7 billion divided by $13.3 billion), no similar level of detail was 
available with respect to Pfizer's historic PRE.  If one were to make the simplifying assumption that the U.S. 
residual tax rate was 20.3 percent on all  $34 billion of the PRE designation that was reversed in this case, the 
accounting tax charge reflecting this PRE reversal would have been approximately $6.8 billion.

Our research finds PRE growth to have been very strong over the past decade. 

Cumulative PRE for 75 c;ompanies (chosen as the top 75  in  a recent Fortune 100 list) showed 
this number growing from about $115 billion in 2000 to about $250 billion in 2005 (a number 
that would have been higher had it not been depleted by repatriations under section 965) and 
reaching over $700 billion by 2010.15  It is possible that some of the PRE growth after the 
expiration of the original section 965 occurred in anticipation of, or preparation for, expected 
impending extension of section 965.  In any event, increased PRE designations raise the baseline 
amounts used for the estimates, and the large increase in PRE conflicts with companies' public 
statements about the need to bring funds back to the United States that are now invested abroad. 
If companies keep adding to PRE but also continue to need those funds at home, then, in the 
absence of section 965  or some other exemption, one would expect that tension would resolve 
itself in favor of taxable dividend repatriations to the United States, as more income would be 
repatriated under present lawl6 and/or the incentive to locate income and investment offshore 
diminishes. 

As a result of the above considerations, the revenue estimate pattern  for both proposals 
shows that, in the first three years after enactment of each proposal, the revenue received by the 
United States associated with the induced repatriated dividends exceeds the two  negative effects 
associated with each proposal, which were:  (1) the U.S.  tax effects on dividends that would have 
been repatriated during the budget period in the absence ofthc proposal; and (2) the proposal's 
effect on prospective decisions about location of investment and income.  However, the positive 
revenue associated with the application of section 965's reduced U.S. residual tax to dividends 

15  This growth in PRE has been noted by others.  Following up on the description of section 965 electors in Susan 

. Albring, Ann Dzuranin, and Lillian F. Mills, "Tax Savings on Repatriations of Foreign Earnings Under the Jobs 
Act," Tax Notes,  August 8, 2005,  the authors Lee A. Sheppard and Martin A. Sullivan, "Multinationals Accumulate 
to Repatriate," Tax Notes,  January 19,2009, showed that accumulated PRE for 40 large companies had by the end 
of2007 recovered from repatriation tmder section 965 during the 2004·2006 period to reach about 200 percent of 
the 2002 PRE amount.  Rodney P. Mock and Andreas Simon, "Pennanently Invested Earnings: Priceless,"  Tax 
Notes,  November 17, 2008, found that,  for a sample of 81  large companies, about one halfofthe reduction in PRE 
owing to section 965 was restored (meaning that accwnulated PRE was replenished) right after section 965 was 
elected by these taxpayers.

that would not have been repatriated in the absence of each proposal fades as the other two 
effects, and particularly the location effects, manifest. 17 

For estimating purposes, we see enactment of section 965  on a stand-alone basis as 

affording taxpayers some of the benefits (but none of the potential detriments) of a dividend 
exemption system:  (1) taxpayers that prefer present law are not required to elect section 965; 
(2) taxpayers that elect section 965 can still avail themselves of cross-crediting (cross-crediting 
generally is eliminated or inhibited in  fornlal  dividend exemption systems) by "filling up the 
base"; 1&  and (3) the exempt portion of dividends under section 965  is subject to only minimal 
disallowance of U.S. deduction of directly allocable expenses incurred in the Unitcd States. t9 
Enacunent of a stand-alone, temporary section 965  for a second time in a seven-year period 
likely signals to taxpayers that something like section 965 will become a periodic, if not a 

17  It may be helpful to provide some context regarding the  internationalization of the u.s. tax base in the later years 
of the budget period with reference to the location effects.  The U.S. corporate tax in the later years of the budget 
period is anticipated to generate over $300 billion in net receipts per year, and foreign taxes credited against U.S. 
corporate taxes are projected to be between $75 and $125 billion annually.  These magnitudes indicate both the 
globalization or U.S.  companies, as noted above, and the scope of how a change in the treatment of foreign  source 
income could alter U.S.  corporate tax receipts. 

I I  "Filling up the base" (where "base" refers to the historical average test for exemption under section 965) describes 
a taxpayer's opportunity to identify which specific dividends qualify for exemption (foreign tax payments associated 
with such exempted dividends are disallowed for the purpose of calculating foreign tax credits).  This choice permits 
the taxpayer to "cherry pick" to ensure that the DRD applies to repatriated foreign  dividen~ thai attracted modest 
foreign tax, thus preserving the use of dividends (i.e., not applying section 965 and its concomitant redllction in 
foreign taxes eligible for the foreign tax credit) that attracted higher levels of foreign tax for cross-crediting against 
non-dividend income such as royalties and interest.  Evidence of the selectivity of filling IIp the base in Redrniles 
(2008, op.  cit.) shows that the overwhelming amount of qualified dividends came from foreign countries with low 
tax rates, which contrasts with the evidence that many section 965 electors were large U.S. muhinational companies 
(Mock and Simon, 2008, op.  cit.). These multinationals, according to their financial  reports, tend to conduct activity 
in  foreign countries with both low and high tax rates  - thus,  in the absence oftbe use of me permitted selectivity, 
one would have expected a more heterogeneous geographic (and perhaps industriaJ) mix in the character of the 
dividends that qualified for exemption Ilnder section 965. 

L9  For 2004 throllgh 2006, only about S600 million of expense was disallowed. for deduction in the United States 
because it was directly allocable to the almost S300 billion of dividends qllalified for exemption under section 965 
(Redmiles, 2008, op.  Cit.).  This comparison to a dividend exemption system assumes that such a system incllldes 
some meaningful expense disallowance rules.  Many dividend exemption systems in place in  foreign jurisdictions do 
not have such rules, while some impose an exemption "haircllt" as a proxy for expense disallowance.

pennanent, feature of the Code.  The foregoing aspects of your section 965 proposals would 
create a quasi-dividend-exemption elective system that would reside within the worldwide 
approach to taxation generally embodied in the present-law Code. 

It is also important to consider some of the macroeconomic/stimulus issues related to 

extension of section 965.  One would expect some positive U.S. tax base effects from the 
potential repatriation of about $700 billion for the 85-percent DRD proposal (of which about 
$200 billion is asswned by us to  be accelerated repatriation that would have occurred in any case 
during  the budget period 1ll1der present law), or $325 billion in the case afthe 70-percent DRD 
proposal (of which about $125 billion is assumed by us to be accelerated repatriation that would 
have occurred in any case during  the budget period under present law),2o that we anticipate for 
these reenactments of section 965 (coming after the $300 billion of qualified repatriation for the 
original enactment of section 965), even if the dividend reinvestment  stipulation in section 965 
does not restrict taxpayers very much.  Indeed, as noted above, we have included some tax base 
effects reflecting the usage of qualified repatriations under your proposals.  However, at least 
thus far, the research has shown little macroeconomic benefit from the original enactment of 
section 965;  this may be due to the difficulty in measuring these effects, or it may be due to how 
the repatriated funds were used, or it may be that a $300 billion repatriation barely registered in a 
U.S. economy with more than $10 trillion in 2005 of Gross National Product ($15 trillion in 
2011).  Aside from the general issue of measuring the initial impact of section 965 with respect 
to these effects, it is also necessary to  recognize that, while section 965  facilitates the return of 
the stock of deferred earnings to the United States, prospectively it also encourages investment 
andlor earnings to be located overseas, and thus enactment of a stand-alone section 965 may 
curtail one distortion (repatriation) while enhancing another distortion (investment and earnings 
location).  As a result, it would be necessary to look at the long-term macroeconomic aspects of 
each proposal and not just the early effects associated with the initial repatriation influx. 

We note three interconnected factors that cause these estimates to  differ from prior 

estimates of similar proposals (with the most recent estimate, from early 2009, of -$28.6 billion 

20  This $200 billion for the 85-perceot DRD proposal and the respective $125 billion for the 70-percent DRD 
proposal include some dividends that we assume would be repatriated under present law in the 2011·2021 budget 
period without any direct connection to a PRE reversal, and some dividends that we assume would be associated 
with PRE reversals we anticipate WIder present law in the 2011 -2021  budget period.

for the fiscal year 2009-2019 period for an  85-percent DRD proposal)?l  First, as noted above, 
PRE designations are reported to have increased significantly, particularly in the past few years. 
Second, the macroeconomic assumptions on which we base our estimates have improved as the 
recent recession has abated, and this added projected corporate profit growth has raised the 
baseline projections of domestic and foreign earnings and investment that would be affected by a 
reenacttnent of section 965.  Third, evidence of PRE reversal suggests that it is not unrealistic to 
assume that, under present law, some companies may be compelled to access profits in the 
United States either by repatriation or by changing prospective location ofincome-genemting 
activity to the United States. 

Finally, it may be helpful if we consider the interaction of proposals like yours with some 
broader tax reform ideas.  As noted above, it is our view that eaeh of your stand-alone proposals 
creates a system within a system, contributing to the overall negative revenue results presented 
above.  This systemic conflict would be absent from a broader refonn proposal that might be 
coupled with something conceptually like section 965 (but perhaps mandatory and with more 
than minimal expense disallowance) as transition in a major overhaul of how the Code treats 
foreign source income.  As a result, the revenue estimate for something like section 965 that is 
enacted as part of a broader reform likely is different from the revenue results presented above 
for two proposals for a stand-alone section 965.22 

11  Statement by Senator Carl Levin, Congressional Record-Senate, February 3, 2009, page S1413 . 

11 1f a broad reform is acc.ompanied by an elective version of section 965, the character of the reform will affect the 
incentive for taxpayers to repatriate accumulated deferred earnings at the time of transition to the new system.  For 
example, both a dividend exemption reform, and a refonn that retains present law while repealing deferral, likely 
would, for different reasons, reduce the incentive of taxpayers to elect section 965 as compared to the stand-alone 
965 that you proposed above.  A territorial regime would reduce this incentive because taxpayers would anticipate 
the future stream of dividends that could be repatriated without U.S. taxation (and perhaps linle or 00 denial of a tax 
deduction for dcmestic expenses linked to the prospective dividends) under a territorial regime, so there might be 
less need by companies to repatriate the accwnulated stock of earnings deferred under the present law worldwide 
regime which is to be replaced by the territorial regime.  00 the other hand, a reform that amends present law by 
repealing deferral also would permit taxpayers to repatriate, at no additional U.S.  tax cost, prospective earnings that 
would already have been taxed by the  United States as  earned, and such repatriation of prospective earnings would, 
unlike repatriation under something like your proposals for a stand-alone  section  965 with an 85-percent or 70-
percent DRD as an increment to present law,  incur no additional U.S. tax as repatriation of prospective earnings 
would by defmition be considered by the United States to be previously taxed income.

(2/18/09) 

However, Cisco filed an amended return with the IRS for FY06 that reduces the 
section 965 dividends received deduction to  zero.  The reason for the reduction 
was to reflect agreed IRS audit adjustments from a prior IRS audit c.ycle 
(concluded subsequent to  Cisco's filing of its original FY06 tax return) which had 
the effect of re·characterizing Cisco's FY06 $1 .2 billion extraordinary CFC 
dividend as  a distribution of previously taxed income under section 959(a)(1).

Response To

Redacted By The 

Permanent Subcommittee 

Q17. 

Please provide any available data demonstrating how your corporation's amounts 
repatriated under section 965 have yielded a net increase in your corporation's U.S. 
jobs or a net increase in your corporation's U.S. research and development 
expenditures. 

A17. 

The answers to questions  11  and 12 show a positive correlation between amounts that 
Oracle repatriated and increases in Oracle's U.S. employment and research and 
development: 

• 
In FY2004, the year before 
employees and spent approximately 
• 

Four 

rep'atnate,d, Oracle had 16,888 U.S. 
in U.S. research &  development. 

(),.."I. had 26,581  US employees, a 57% increase, and spent 

in U.S. research and development, a 94% increase. 

Oracle's primary competitor in the software applications business is SAP AG 

• 
(headquartered in Frankfurt, Gennany).  In FY2002, Oracle was  1/5th the size (measured 
by application sales) of SAP AG.  By 2008, Oracle had closed the gap substantially and is 
now half the size of SAP AG. 

As noted in Oracle's DRP. a portion of Oracle's repatriated funds was used in FY 2005 
for two key acquisitions critical to Oracle's long·term growth and competitiveness 
internationally.  For example, repatriated cash enabled Oracle to outbid and acquire Retek 
Inc., a Minnesota· based provider of retail software and services.  SAP AG had made an 
offer to acquire Retek, and stated publicly that it intended to move Retek's development 
jobs and intellectual property to Germany.  Oracle's successful acquisition of Retek had 
the inunediate effect of retaining all of Retek's jobs in Minnesota and Georgia.  Since the 

Permanent Subcommittee on  Investip"ations

77Retek acquisition, Oracle has increased by 50 percent its Retek related employment in 
Minnesota and Georgia. 

Oracle's substantial net employment and research and development growth since FY2005 
carne at a time of significant growth in Oracle's sales internationally.  Today. Oracle 
operates in  145 countries, and generates approximately 60% of its revenues from 
overseas license sales and support, contributing positively to the U.S. balance of trade.

ORACLE CORPORATION 

SECTION 965 DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN 

As  of  May  31 ,  2003,  Oracle  Corporation  ("Oracle")  had  13.1  billion  of 
cumulative earnings  indefm.itely reinvested outside the United States,("2003 Cumulative 
Foreign  Earnings'').  Oracle's  2003  Cumulative  Foreign  Earnings  are  reflected  in 
footnote 14 of Oracle' s  audited financial statements for the period ending May 31 . 2003, 
which were certified by Ernst &  Young LLP on June 12, 2003 (except for the second and 
fourth  paragraphs or Note 17 and Note  18, which  were certified on June  18, 2003),  and 
filed  with  the  SEC  on  June  24,  2003.  In order  to  fund  the objectives  set  forth  in this 
Domestic  Reinvestment  Plan  (the  ·'Plan").  Oracle  will  cause  Oracle  Technology 
Company and Oracle Systems Hong Kong Limited, its wholly owned subsidiaries, to pay 
cash  dividends  equal  to  $3. 1  billion  during  the  fiscal  year  ending  May  31,  2005  (the 
"Section 965  Dividends'').  Oracle  intends for  the Section 965  Dividends to qualify for 
the Temporary Dividends Received Deduction under Section 965 of the Internal Revenue 
Code, enacted pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  ntis Plan is Oracle's 
plan  to  invest  the  Section  965  Dividends  in  the  United  States  as  required  by section 
965(b)(4). 

Plan Oblectives 

J 

During the period including Oracle's fiscal years ending May 31, 2005, May 31, 
2006, May 31, 2007, and May 31, 2008, Oracle intends to use the cash proceeds from the 
Section  965  Dividends  as  a  source  of  funding  for  the  acquisition  of  U.S.  capital 
invesbnents.  If Oracle later determines that it is not prudent to use the cash proceeds as a 
source of funding  for capital invesbnents, it will use tlie proceeds as a source of funding 
for (j) its U.S. payroll costs and/or (ii) its ongoing U.S. research and development efforts 
related to the development of software and related products ~d seJVices. 

Investments in  the United States 

Consistent with the Plan Objectives, Oracle intends to  use the cash proceeds from 

the Section 965 Dividends as a source of funding for the following investments:

placed in a much better position to capitalize on Dew business opportunities and

85Offshore tax dodging hurts U.S. business 
Michigan  Midland  Daily News 
By Paul Egerman  I Posted: Tuesday,  June 7,  2011  7:00 am 

When a company like General Electric pays  little or no  U.S. income taxes,  it has 
troubling  implications for domestic business and our entire society. 

As a businessman and entrepreneur,  I believe it is myopic tax policy to force 
domestic enterprises to compete on an  un level playing field against companies 
that use offshore tax havens to relocate profits. 

Our current upside down corporate tax  system means that a U.S. manufacturer, 
insurance company,  retailer,  or technology firm  must compete against another 
company based not on product quality and  services,  but on accounting 
gymnastics. 

Many multinational companies use a gimmick called "transfer pricing," to 
represent that they've earned their profits at a subsidiary in  an offshore tax haven 
nation like the Cayman Islands or Luxembourg, even though 99  percent of their 
operations and sales are not there. 

This accounting game enables these shell subsidiaries to  pay little or no 
corporate income tax, while the  U.S. parent company represents to the IRS that 
they've lost money on their U.S.  operations. A recent estimate of revenue lost 
due to this tax dodging dance is $90 billion a year, an amount approaching the 
total budget gaps of all  U.S. states combined. 

This is  only one example of the exotic loopholes that U.S.  multinational 
corporations utilize that put domestic employers at an  unfair disadvantage. 

It is simply wrong that a U.S-based multinational company is able to report profits 
to their shareholders and losses to  Uncle Sam. 

When  General Electric or Boeing or Phizer deploy armies of accountants to 
game their tax bill down, it simply means the rest of us are left responsible for the 
bill. 

And  now, a coalition of global corporations is calling for a tax holiday so they can 
bring  home over $1  trillion profits that they parked offshore without paying the 
same corporate income rate that most domestic companies pay. Congress' Joint 
Committee on Taxation estimates this move would cost the U.S. $80  billion over 
ten years.

86Aggressive tax avoidance raises the question of what kind of country we want to 
have and who is going to pay for it. 

To make our views public,  hundreds of business owners and CEOs like  me have 
signed a statement calling for the end of tax haven abuse. We welcome other 
business people and investors to sign at the website, www. 
businessagainsttaxhavens.org. 

There are millions of U.S.  business people in  this country who work extremely 
hard to reach customers,  provide better services, build better widgets - and pay 
their local, state and federal taxes.  When times are lean,  we don't look to our 
accountant to bring home the bacon. 

Paying our fair share of business taxes is the price we pay not only to live in a 
civilized society, but also a reasonable levy to conduct business in a vibrant, 
regulated marketplace with  property rights protections, public infrastructure, and 
the rule of law. 

If companies like General Electric want to enjoy the fruits of this taxpayer funded 
business environment, then they should end their aggressive tax avoidance and 
take responsibility for paying their fair share. 

The bills have to be paid - and no one should be able to opt out simply because 
they are  politically connected and  big.  It undermines the entire system of 
government and  is reprehensible that some corporations pay nothing toward the 
range of public goods that includes Centers for Disease Control, homeless 
shelters,  and schools for our kids . 

As a business owner and as an  individual,  I never resented paying taxes, as long 
as we had a relatively level playing field. The price we pay is  not excessive. 

In the 1970s,  I paid a much higher percentage of my income than I do today. 
Even compared to  President Reagan's  1980 tax reform, the effective rate of my 
personal income taxes is dramatically less today. At the same time, the share of 
U.S. taxes paid by corporations is at an historical low because of subsidies, 
loopholes and other tax avoidance strategies. 

Congress should not allow a tax holiday for offshore tax dodgers and  instead 
should pass  legislation like the Stop Tax Haven Abuse law that would be a huge 
step toward  leveling the corporate tax playing field.

A Charlie Brown Congress? 
By  Frank  Knapp Jr.  ~ 06/29/ 11  02: 10  PM  ET 

Lucy is at it again. "I'll hold the ball, and you come running and kick it," Lucy tells 
Charlie Brown. 

We all know what to expect. Charlie Brown will run to kick the football and Lucy will 
pull it away ... again. Charlie will fall flat on his back. 

This gag is playing out right now in Congress. U.S. multinational corporations (aka 
Lucy) are holding hundreds of billions of dollars in profits overseas to avoid paying U.S. 
taxes. They want Congress (aka Charlie Brown) to let them bring those dollars back to 
the U.S. without paying hardly any taxes (Congress committing to kick the ball) in the 
belief they will invest them in production and hiring here at home (the football flying 
through the air instead of Charlie). 

This process is caned a "repatriation tax holiday" and, just as in the Peanuts cartoon, 
Congress has seen this before. 

In 2004, most ofthe same multinational corporations made the same offer. Even the 
Bush administration thought it was a bad idea and said it would be unfair to companies 
who had "already paid their full and fair share of tax" and "would not produce any 
substantial economic benefits." 

Still, Congress agreed to a "one-time-only"  repatriation run at the ball. But instead of 
using their almost tax-free billions for hiring and investing here, companies like 
Hewlett-Packard, Pfizer, Ford Motor Company, Merck and Honeywell International 
gave big windfalls to their corporate ovmers and shareholders in stock buybacks and 
dividends while laying off tens of thousands of American workers. 

The National Bureau of Economic Research found that the tax holiday did not increase 
domestic investment, employment or research and development. Instead, they found, a 
dollar increase in repatriated earnings was associated with an increase of almost a dollar 
in payouts to shareholders. 

It's not that Congress has amnesia about this failed tax policy, as some have suggested. 
Charlie Brovm remembers Lucy's trick all too well.

Repatriating Offshore Funds

88"You must think I'm stupid," Charlie Brown tells Lucy in the Great Pumpkin episode. 
But Lucy persists, "This time you can trust me. See, here is a signed document testifying 
that I promise not to pull it away." 

Tax holiday advocates say this time the legislation will  really guarantee that the 
repatriated profits will be used to invest and create jobs in America. 

Charlie Brown, in spite of all  of us yelling, "Don't do it," gives in. "It's a signed 
document," he says. "I guess if you have a signed document in your possession, you can't 
go wrong. This year I am really going to kick that football. " 

"AAUGH! " 

Lucy pulled the football away with the excuse the document wasn't notarized. 

There's no foolproof way of writing legislation to stop corporations from behaving the 
way they did in 2005. And the reality is that the corporations don't really need the 
repatriated profits to invest and create jobs here. As conservatively calculated by the 
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities from company financial statements, the ten 
corporations doing the heaviest tax holiday lobbying (Adobe Systems, Apple, CA 
Technologies, Cisco, Duke Energy, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, pfizer and Qualcomm) 
have at least $47 billion in cash and other liquid assets readily available for domestic 
investment and job creation right now. 

When Lucy suckers Charlie Brown more than once, she knows that she can do it again 
and again. 

Giving U.S. multinational corporations another "repatriation tax holiday" will encourage 
them to shift even more of their profits into offshore tax havens until the next time they 
trick Congress to try and kick the ball. As a result, our country's deficit will increase 
when an estimated $79 billion more in corporate taxes is not collected over the next 10 
years according to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation. That means the rest of us 
will continue to pay more than our fair share for the essential services of government. 

These big corporations benefit immensely from all the advantages of being 
headquartered in our country. They need to start paying their taxes just as every citizen 
and sman business does. 

That's why Congress should listen to our raised voices: "Don't do it, Charlie Brown!"

89Letter to Congress:  No Tax Holiday for U.S. Multinationals 
June 14, 2011 

Dear Senators and Representatives, 

As business organizations with small business members throughout the United States, we call  upon 
Congress to reject pleas by U.S. multinational corporations for short and long-term tax holidays on 
profits held offshore, and to instead close the tax loopholes that reward companies for transferring 
U.S. profits, jobs and investment abroad. 

Too many corporations have turned their tax departments into profit centers, using aggressive 
accounting manipulation to disguise U.S. profits as foreign profits. This is done for the express 
purpose of avoiding tax payments.  Now we find a coalition of corporate tax avoiders demanding a 
tax holiday in order to  bring home the funds they shifted offshore to avoid paying taxes. This 
proposed "repatriation" would not be a win for America. It would cost the U.S. Treasury $80 billion 
according to the Joint Committee on Taxation and increase pressure to cut government spending on 
services our businesses depend on. We also oppose changing to a territorial tax system, which 
would accelerate the use of aggressive accounting techniques to shift domestic profits to overseas 
tax havens, permanently rewarding those who seek to avoid their taxpaying responsibilities. 

Bloomberg Business Week recently illustrated examples of this tax avoiding behavior:  Forest 
Laboratories "sells nearly 100 percent of its drugs in the U.S. - and cuts its U.S. taxes dramatically 
by attributing the bulk of its profits to a law office in  Bermuda .... Google reduced its income taxes by 
$3.1  billion over three years by shifting income to Ireland, then the Netherlands, and ultimately to 
Bermuda." We need to stop this irresponsible tax avoidance, which undermines the U.S. economy, 
and assure that all businesses play by the same tax rules. 

There is simply no excuse for repeating a policy that's a proven failure.  In 2004, a corporate 
"repatriation tax holiday" was passed with the promise of stimulating domestic investment and 
creating jobs in the United States. Instead, studies showed that the beneficiaries of the tax holiday 
used their repatriated earnings to give a huge windfall to corporate owners and shareholders -
including many CEOs - in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. For example, the National 
Bureau of Economic Research found that a dollar increase in repatriated earnings "was associated 
with an increase of almost $1 in payouts to shareholders." In the wake of the tax holiday, U.S. 
multinationals eliminated more American jobs and shifted even more income and investment to 
offshore tax havens. 

Corporate taxes,  like individual income taxes, support the public services and infrastructure upon 
which all  businesses depend. These include a publicly educated workforce, transportation systems, 
safe drinking water and sanitation, the judicial system, taxpayer-funded research (which played a 
crucial role in health advances and the creation of the Internet, for example), federal emergency 
response and so on.  But,  the public services and infrastructure underpinning a healthy economy are 
now being cut dramatically because of inadequate revenues. 

When powerful large U.S. corporations avoid their fair share of taxes, they undermine U.S. 
competitiveness, contribute to the national debt and shift more of the tax burden to domestic 
businesses, especially small businesses that create most of the new jobs. A transparent corporate 
tax system that assures all companies - large and small - pay for the services upon which our 
businesses, our customers, our workforce and our communities depend, would help restore the 
economic vitality and domestic job creation we all seek.
