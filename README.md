US Senate subcommittee 2011 report on a review into the American Jobs Creation Act, a 2004 tax reform that allowed US multinationals to repatriate foreign earnings at a reduced tax rate provided they were used to increase employment and research & development. It concluded that the reform benefited some US multinationals, but failed to yield any appreciable benefit for the economy.
